ted_01096_0012610_0016680 back in new york i am the head of development for a nonprofit called robin hood
ted_01096_0016900_0022040 when i &apos;m not fighting poverty i &apos;m fighting fires as the assistant captain of a volunteer fire company
ted_01096_0022530_0030630 now in our town where the volunteers supplement a highly skilled career staff you have to get to the fire scene pretty early to get in on any action
ted_01096_0031520_0033070 i remember my first fire
ted_01096_0033340_0037490 i was the second volunteer on the scene so there was a pretty good chance i was going to get in
ted_01096_0038480_0044050 but still it was a real footrace against the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge to find out what our assignments would be
ted_01096_0044910_0053510 when i found the captain he was having a very engaging conversation with the homeowner who was surely having one of the worst days of her life
ted_01096_0054200_0063790 here it was the middle of the night she was standing outside in the pouring rain under an umbrella in her pajamas barefoot while her house was in flames
ted_01096_0065150_0083490 the other volunteer who had arrived just before me let &apos;s call him lex luther laughter got to the captain first and was asked to go inside and save the homeowner &apos;s dog the dog i was stunned with jealousy
ted_01096_0083680_0094050 here was some lawyer or money manager who for the rest of his life gets to tell people that he went into a burning building to save a living creature just because he beat me by five seconds
ted_01096_0094150_0096190 well i was next
ted_01096_0096810_0098210 the captain waved me over
ted_01096_0098580_0110670 he said bezos i need you to go into the house i need you to go upstairs past the fire and i need you to get this woman a pair of shoes laughter i swear
ted_01096_0112120_0126120 so not exactly what i was hoping for but off i went up the stairs down the hall past the &apos; real &apos; firefighters who were pretty much done putting out the fire at this point into the master bedroom to get a pair of shoes
ted_01096_0126140_0142550 now i know what you &apos;re thinking but i &apos;m no hero laughter i carried my payload back downstairs where i met my nemesis and the precious dog by the front door
ted_01096_0143860_0151270 we took our treasures outside to the homeowner where not surprisingly his received much more attention than did mine
ted_01096_0152230_0158260 a few weeks later the department received a letter from the homeowner thanking us for the valiant effort displayed in saving her home
ted_01096_0159150_0165070 the act of kindness she noted above all others someone had even gotten her a pair of shoes
ted_01096_0166725_0166925 laughter
ted_01096_0167020_0180320 in both my vocation at robin hood and my avocation as a volunteer firefighter i am witness to acts of generosity and kindness on a monumental scale but i &apos;m also witness to acts of grace and courage on an individual basis
ted_01096_0181060_0195260 and you know what i &apos;ve learned they all matter so as i look around this room at people who either have achieved or are on their way to achieving remarkable levels of success i would offer this reminder don &apos;t wait
ted_01096_0197020_0200060 don &apos;t wait until you make your first million to make a difference in somebody &apos;s life
ted_01096_0200340_0203140 if you have something to give give it now
ted_01096_0204200_0208500 serve food at a soup kitchen clean up a neighborhood park be a mentor
ted_01096_0209340_0216380 not every day is going to offer us a chance to save somebody &apos;s life but every day offers us an opportunity to affect one
ted_01096_0216900_0219310 so get in the game save the shoes
ted_01096_0219880_0228600 thank you
ted_01096_0228525_0228725 applause
ted_01096_0228650_0234020 bruno giussani mark mark come back
ted_01096_0235700_0235900 mark bezos thank you
ted_01102_0012780_0016900 i just came back from a community that holds the secret to human survival
ted_01102_0018390_0027820 it &apos;s a place where women run the show have sex to say hello and play rules the day where fun is serious business
ted_01102_0028360_0036790 and no this isn &apos;t burning man or san francisco laughter ladies and gentlemen meet your cousins
ted_01102_0037520_0041210 this is the world of wild bonobos in the jungles of congo
ted_01102_0042130_0047960 bonobos are together with chimpanzees your living closest relative
ted_01102_0048640_0055620 that means we all share a common ancestor an evolutionary grandmother who lived around six million years ago
ted_01102_0057210_0061200 now chimpanzees are wellknown for their aggression
ted_01102_0065055_0065255 laughter
ted_01102_0065180_0071940 but unfortunately we have made too much of an emphasis of this aspect in our narratives of human evolution
ted_01102_0073580_0076780 but bonobos show us the other side of the coin
ted_01102_0077850_0098180 while chimpanzees are dominated by big scary guys bonobo society is run by empowered females these guys have really worked something out since this leads to a highly tolerant society where fatal violence has not been observed yet
ted_01102_0100020_0104400 but unfortunately bonobos are the least understood of the great apes
ted_01102_0105220_0111320 they live in the depths of the congolese jungle and it has been very difficult to study them
ted_01102_0111880_0131700 the congo is a paradox a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty but also the heart of darkness itself the scene of a violent conflict that has raged for decades and claimed nearly as many lives as the first world war
ted_01102_0133580_0138940 not surprisingly this destruction also endangers bonobo survival
ted_01102_0139750_0150090 bushmeat trades and forest loss means we couldn &apos;t fill a small stadium with all the bonobos that are left in the world and we &apos;re not even sure of that to be honest
ted_01102_0151500_0159640 yet in this land of violence and chaos you can hear hidden laughter swaying the trees
ted_01102_0160270_0174690 who are these cousins we know them as the make love not war apes since they have frequent promiscuous and bisexual sex to manage conflict and solve social issues
ted_01102_0175100_0184440 now i &apos;m not saying this is the solution to all of humanity &apos;s problems since there &apos;s more to bonobo life than the kama sutra
ted_01102_0185500_0189000 bonobos like humans love to play throughout their entire lives
ted_01102_0189570_0191530 play is not just child &apos;s games
ted_01102_0192030_0197510 for us and them play is foundational for bonding relationships and fostering tolerance
ted_01102_0198230_0202140 it &apos;s where we learn to trust and where we learn about the rules of the game
ted_01102_0203580_0217060 play increases creativity and resilience and it &apos;s all about the generation of diversity diversity of interactions diversity of behaviors diversity of connections
ted_01102_0218780_0226570 and when you watch bonobo play you &apos;re seeing the very evolutionary roots of human laughter dance and ritual
ted_01102_0227770_0230520 play is the glue that binds us together
ted_01102_0231860_0238510 now i don &apos;t know how you play but i want to show you a couple of unique clips fresh from the wild
ted_01102_0238910_0243910 first it &apos;s a ball game bonobostyle and i do not mean football
ted_01102_0244480_0250140 so here we have a young female and a male engaged in a chase game
ted_01102_0250970_0252330 have a look what she &apos;s doing
ted_01102_0253150_0263090 it might be the evolutionary origin of the phrase she &apos;s got him by the balls laughter only i think that he &apos;s rather loving it here right
ted_01102_0264900_0271590 yeah laughter so sex play is common in both bonobos and humans
ted_01102_0272750_0294030 and this video is really interesting because it shows this video &apos;s really interesting because it shows the inventiveness of bringing unusual elements into play such as testicles and also how play both requires trust and fosters trust while at the same time being tremendous fun
ted_01102_0294830_0310340 but play &apos;s a shapeshifter laughter play &apos;s a shapeshifter and it can take many forms some of which are more quiet imaginative curious maybe where wonder is discovered anew
ted_01102_0310900_0315990 and i want you to see this is fuku a young female and she is quietly playing with water
ted_01102_0317070_0323840 i think like her we sometimes play alone and we explore the boundaries of our inner and our outer worlds
ted_01102_0325320_0336690 and it &apos;s that playful curiosity that drives us to explore drives us to interact and then the unexpected connections we form are the real hotbed for creativity
ted_01102_0338330_0345180 so these are just small tasters into the insights that bonobo give us to our past and present
ted_01102_0345970_0357160 but they also hold a secret for our future a future where we need to adapt to an increasingly challenging world through greater creativity and greater cooperation
ted_01102_0358100_0362800 the secret is that play is the key to these capacities
ted_01102_0363530_0366800 in other words play is our adaptive wildcard
ted_01102_0367720_0372580 in order to adapt successfully to a changing world we need to play
ted_01102_0375160_0378370 but will we make the most of our playfulness
ted_01102_0378880_0387380 play is not frivolous play &apos;s essential for bonobos and humans alike life is not just red in tooth and claw
ted_01102_0388270_0394040 in times when it seems least appropriate to play it might be the times when it is most urgent
ted_01102_0395240_0408700 and so my fellow primates let us embrace this gift from evolution and play together as we rediscover creativity fellowship and wonder
ted_01102_0408860_0409330 thank you
ted_01102_0412925_0413125 applause
ted_01104_0012850_0028840 i want you now to imagine a wearable robot that gives you superhuman abilities or another one that takes wheelchair users up standing and walking again
ted_01104_0030550_0034870 we at berkeley bionics call these robots exoskeletons
ted_01104_0035720_0053040 these are nothing else than something that you put on in the morning and it will give you extra strength and it will further enhance your speed and it will help you for instance to manage your balance
ted_01104_0053880_0059250 it is actually the true integration of the man and the machine
ted_01104_0059940_0067080 but not only that it will integrate and network you to the universe and other devices out there
ted_01104_0067770_0069880 this is just not some blue sky thinking
ted_01104_0070140_0083930 to show you now what we are working on by starting out talking about the american soldier that on average does carry about 100 lbs on their backs and they are being asked to carry more equipment
ted_01104_0084930_0095130 obviously this is resulting in some major complications back injuries 30 percent of them chronic back injuries
ted_01104_0095530_0104410 so we thought we would look at this challenge and create an exoskeleton that would help deal with this issue
ted_01104_0105620_0113220 so let me now introduce to you hulc or the human universal load carrier
ted_01104_0115090_0119780 soldier with the hulc exoskeleton i can carry 200 lbs over varied terrain for many hours
ted_01104_0120160_0125280 its flexible design allows for deep squats crawls and highagility movements
ted_01104_0125820_0130720 it senses what i want to do where i want to go and then augments my strength and endurance
ted_01104_0134180_0141480 eythor bender we are ready with our industry partner to introduce this device this new exoskeleton this year
ted_01104_0142120_0143010 so this is for real
ted_01104_0144240_0152150 now let &apos;s turn our heads towards the wheelchair users something that i &apos;m particularly passionate about
ted_01104_0153380_0157990 there are 68 million people estimated to be in wheelchairs worldwide
ted_01104_0158550_0161690 this is about one percent of the total population
ted_01104_0161760_0163900 and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate
ted_01104_0164440_0176460 we are talking here about oftentimes very young individuals with spinal cord injuries that in the prime of their life 20s 30s 40s hit a wall and the wheelchair &apos;s the only option
ted_01104_0176740_0180460 but it is also the aging population that is multiplying in numbers
ted_01104_0181080_0188700 and the only option pretty much when it &apos;s stroke or other complications is the wheelchair
ted_01104_0188700_0195060 and that is actually for the last 500 years since its very successful introduction i must say
ted_01104_0196880_0202880 so we thought we would start writing a brand new chapter of mobility
ted_01104_0204520_0221610 let me now introduce you to elegs that is worn by amanda boxtel that 19 years ago was spinal cord injured and as a result of that she has not been able to walk for 19 years until now
ted_01104_0221535_0221735 applause
ted_01104_0232430_0235240 amanda boxtel thank you
ted_01104_0235440_0248690 eb amanda is wearing our elegs set it has sensors it &apos;s completely noninvasive sensors in the crutches that send signals back to our onboard computer that is sitting here at her back
ted_01104_0249480_0262410 there are battery packs here as well that power motors that are sitting at her hips as well as her knee joints that move her forward in this kind of smooth and very natural gait
ted_01104_0265020_0274090 ab i was 24 years old and at the top of my game when a freak summersault while downhill skiing paralyzed me
ted_01104_0274730_0281180 in a split second i lost all sensation and movement below my pelvis
ted_01104_0282390_0296000 not long afterwards a doctor strode into my hospital room and he said amanda you &apos;ll never walk again and that was 19 yeas ago
ted_01104_0297000_0301480 he robbed every ounce of hope from my being
ted_01104_0302470_0310440 adaptive technology has since enabled me to learn how to downhill ski again to rock climb and even handcycle
ted_01104_0310650_0319070 but nothing has been invented that enables me to walk until now
ted_01104_0327455_0327655 applause
ted_01104_0327545_0327745 thank you
ted_01104_0332940_0340820 eb as you can see we have the technology we have the platforms to sit down and have discussions with you
ted_01104_0342050_0360000 it &apos;s in our hands and we have all the potential here to change the lives of future generations not only for the soldiers or for amanda here and all the wheelchair users but for everyone
ted_01104_0362460_0362670 ab thanks
ted_01104_0362595_0362795 applause
ted_01114_0012750_0021920 i have spent the past few years putting myself into situations that are usually very difficult and at the same time somewhat dangerous
ted_01114_0022430_0026270 i went to prison difficult
ted_01114_0027480_0030940 i worked in a coal mine dangerous
ted_01114_0032250_0035630 i filmed in war zones difficult and dangerous
ted_01114_0036770_0045360 and i spent 30 days eating nothing but this fun in the beginning little difficult in the middle very dangerous in the end
ted_01114_0047080_0064800 in fact most of my career i &apos;ve been immersing myself into seemingly horrible situations for the whole goal of trying to examine societal issues in a way that make them engaging that make them interesting that hopefully break them down in a way that make them entertaining and accessible to an audience
ted_01114_0065230_0072100 so when i knew i was coming here to do a ted talk that was going to look at the world of branding and sponsorship i knew i would want to do something a little different
ted_01114_0072690_0077540 so as some of you may or may not have heard a couple weeks ago i took out an ad on ebay
ted_01114_0078660_0111220 i sent out some facebook messages some twitter messages and i gave people the opportunity to buy the naming rights to my 2011 ted talk laughter that &apos;s right some lucky individual corporation forprofit or nonprofit was going to get the onceinalifetime opportunity because i &apos;m sure chris anderson will never let it happen again laughter to buy the naming rights to the talk you &apos;re watching right now that at the time didn &apos;t have a title didn &apos;t really have a lot of content and didn &apos;t really give much hint as to what the subject matter would actually be
ted_01114_0112240_0125680 so what you were getting was this your name here presents my ted talk that you have no idea what the subject is and depending on the content could ultimately blow up in your face especially if i make you or your company look stupid for doing it
ted_01114_0125720_0150790 but that being said it &apos;s a very good media opportunity laughter you know how many people watch these ted talks it &apos;s a lot that &apos;s just a working title by the way laughter so even with that caveat i knew that someone would buy the naming rights
ted_01114_0150790_0153960 now if you &apos;d have asked me that a year ago i wouldn &apos;t have been able to tell you that with any certainty
ted_01114_0154480_0158640 but in the new project that i &apos;m working on my new film we examine the world of marketing advertising
ted_01114_0159970_0181730 and as i said earlier i put myself in some pretty horrible situations over the years but nothing could prepare me nothing could ready me for anything as difficult or as dangerous as going into the rooms with these guys laughter you see i had this idea for a movie
ted_01114_0181740_0190710 video morgan spurlock what i want to do is make a film all about product placement marketing and advertising where the entire film is funded by product placement marketing and advertising
ted_01114_0191350_0212060 so the movie will be called the greatest movie ever sold so what happens in the greatest movie ever sold is that everything from top to bottom from start to finish is branded from beginning to end from the abovethetitle sponsor that you &apos;ll see in the movie which is brand x now this brand the qualcomm stadium the staples center these people will be married to the film in perpetuity forever
ted_01114_0212360_0215650 and so the film explores this whole idea michael kassan it &apos;s redundant it &apos;s what mk it &apos;s redundant in perpetuity forever
ted_01114_0217150_0220530 i &apos;m a redundant person mk i &apos;m just saying that was more for emphasis
ted_01114_0221630_0222100 it was in perpetuity
ted_01114_0222330_0227720 forever but not only are we going to have the brand x title sponsor but we &apos;re going to make sure we sell out every category we can in the film
ted_01114_0227830_0236420 so maybe we sell a shoe and it becomes the greatest shoe you ever wore the greatest car you ever drove from the greatest movie ever sold the greatest drink you &apos;ve ever had courtesy of the greatest movie ever sold
ted_01114_0236460_0243160 xavier kochhar so the idea is beyond just showing that brands are a part of your life but actually get them to finance the film ms get them to finance the film
ted_01114_0243170_0245300 ms and actually we show the whole process of how does it work
ted_01114_0245310_0247220 the goal of this whole film is transparency
ted_01114_0247420_0249670 you &apos;re going to see the whole thing take place in this movie
ted_01114_0249770_0253270 so that &apos;s the whole concept the whole film start to finish
ted_01114_0253550_0255510 and i would love for ceg to help make it happen
ted_01114_0255710_0263090 robert friedman you know it &apos;s funny because when i first hear it it is the ultimate respect for an audience
ted_01114_0263100_0267410 guy i don &apos;t know how receptive people are going to be to it though
ted_01114_0267610_0274540 xk do you have a perspective i don &apos;t want to use angle because that has a negative connotation but do you know how this is going to play out ms no idea
ted_01114_0274870_0277150 david cohn how much money does it take to do this
ted_01114_0277920_0279600 ms 15 million dc okay
ted_01114_0280020_0287550 john kamen i think that you &apos;re going to have a hard time meeting with them but i think it &apos;s certainly worth pursuing a couple big really obvious brands
ted_01114_0287560_0291840 xk who knows maybe by the time your film comes out we look like a bunch of blithering idiots
ted_01114_0291850_0293820 ms what do you think the response is going to be
ted_01114_0294120_0296440 stuart ruderfer the responses mostly will be no
ted_01114_0296940_0299190 ms but is it a tough sell because of the film or a tough sell because of me
ted_01114_0300410_0301130 jk both
ted_01114_0301360_0304060 ms meaning not so optimistic
ted_01114_0305820_0307740 so sir can you help me i need help
ted_01114_0308290_0308760 mk i can help you
ted_01114_0309110_0312520 ms okay mk good awesome
ted_01114_0313420_0314990 mk we &apos;ve gotta figure out which brands
ted_01114_0315000_0320090 ms yeah mk that &apos;s the challenge when you look at the people you deal with
ted_01114_0320090_0324890 mk we &apos;ve got some places we can go ms okay turn the camera off
ted_01114_0324890_0331710 ms i thought turn the camera off meant let &apos;s have an offtherecord conversation turns out it really means we want nothing to do with your movie
ted_01114_0332100_0338990 ms and just like that one by one all of these companies suddenly disappeared
ted_01114_0339720_0344970 none of them wanted anything to do with this movie i was amazed they wanted absolutely nothing to do with this project
ted_01114_0344970_0352560 and i was blown away because i thought the whole concept the idea of advertising was to get your product out in front of as many people as possible to get as many people to see it as possible
ted_01114_0352750_0365440 especially in today &apos;s world this intersection of new media and old media and the fractured media landscape isn &apos;t the idea to get that new buzzworthy delivery vehicle that &apos;s going to get that message to the masses
ted_01114_0366460_0367400 no that &apos;s what i thought
ted_01114_0367950_0379480 but the problem was you see my idea had one fatal flaw and that flaw was this actually no that was not the flaw whatsoever
ted_01114_0379480_0380640 that wouldn &apos;t have been a problem at all
ted_01114_0382220_0383140 this would have been fine
ted_01114_0383140_0385230 but what this image represents was the problem
ted_01114_0385250_0396370 see when you do a google image search for transparency this is laughter applause this is one of the first images that comes up
ted_01114_0396650_0399650 so i like the way you roll sergey brin
ted_01114_0399830_0421310 no laughter this is was the problem transparency free from pretense or deceit easily detected or seen through readily understood characterized by visibility or accessibility of information especially concerning business practices that last line being probably the biggest problem
ted_01114_0421730_0423780 you see we hear a lot about transparency these days
ted_01114_0423870_0428570 our politicians say it our president says it even our ceo &apos;s say it
ted_01114_0429030_0450900 but suddenly when it comes down to becoming a reality something suddenly changes but why well transparency is scary roar like that odd stillscreaming bear laughter it &apos;s unpredictable music laughter like this odd country road
ted_01114_0450900_0460730 and it &apos;s also very risky laughter what else is risky
ted_01114_0460810_0470160 eating an entire bowl of cool whip laughter that &apos;s very risky
ted_01114_0472080_0478780 now when i started talking to companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story and they said no we want you to tell a story
ted_01114_0479020_0493960 we want you to tell a story but we just want to tell our story see when i was a kid and my father would catch me in some sort of a lie and there he is giving me the look he often gave me he would say son there &apos;s three sides to every story
ted_01114_0494650_0504110 there &apos;s your story there &apos;s my story and there &apos;s the real story now you see with this film we wanted to tell the real story
ted_01114_0504110_0517530 but with only one company one agency willing to help me and that &apos;s only because i knew john bond and richard kirshenbaum for years i realized that i would have to go on my own i &apos;d have to cut out the middleman and go to the companies myself with all of my team
ted_01114_0517560_0526100 so what you suddenly started to realize or what i started to realize is that when you started having conversations with these companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem
ted_01114_0526330_0530960 video ms i have friends who make great big giant hollywood films and i have friends who make little independent films like i make
ted_01114_0531310_0549780 and the friends of mine who make big giant hollywood movies say the reason their films are so successful is because of the brand partners that they have and then my friends who make small independent films say well how are we supposed to compete with these big giant hollywood movies and the movie is called the greatest movie ever sold so how specifically will we see ban in the film
ted_01114_0550590_0555540 any time i &apos;m ready to go any time i open up my medicine cabinet you will see ban deodorant
ted_01114_0555950_0563240 while anytime i do an interview with someone i can say are you fresh enough for this interview are you ready you look a little nervous
ted_01114_0563530_0564630 i want to help you calm down
ted_01114_0564630_0569900 so maybe you should put some one before the interview so we &apos;ll offer one of these fabulous scents
ted_01114_0569900_0573110 whether it &apos;s a floral fusion or a paradise winds they &apos;ll have their chance
ted_01114_0573530_0578460 we will have them geared for both male or female solid rollon or stick whatever it may be
ted_01114_0579380_0580930 that &apos;s the twocent tour
ted_01114_0581830_0585440 so now i can answer any of your questions and give you the fivecent tour
ted_01114_0585540_0586600 karen frank we are a smaller brand
ted_01114_0586600_0591470 much like you talked about being a smaller movie we &apos;re very much a challenger brand
ted_01114_0591470_0593720 so we don &apos;t have the budgets that other brands have
ted_01114_0593920_0599190 so doing things like this you know remind people about ban is kind of why were interested in it
ted_01114_0599460_0602720 ms what are the words that you would use to describe ban ban is blank
ted_01114_0614440_0614710 kf that &apos;s a great question
ted_01114_0614900_0616820 ms technology &apos;s not the way you want to describe something somebody &apos;s putting in their armpit
ted_01114_0616820_0619350 man we talk about bold fresh
ted_01114_0619730_0627630 i think fresh is a great word that really spins this category into the positive versus fights odor and wetness it keeps you fresh
ted_01114_0627630_0631790 how do we keep you fresher longer better freshness more freshness three times fresher
ted_01114_0631790_0634680 things like that that are more of that positive benefit
ted_01114_0635420_0640330 ms and that &apos;s a multimillion dollar corporation what about me what about a regular guy
ted_01114_0640370_0643830 i need to go talk to the man on the street the people who are like me the regular joes
ted_01114_0643860_0645690 they need to tell me about my brand
ted_01114_0646070_0648320 video ms how would you guys describe your brand
ted_01114_0648640_0652580 man um my brand
ted_01114_0653920_0654400 i don &apos;t know

ted_01114_0657510_0663000 woman 80 &apos;s revival meets skaterpunk unless it &apos;s laundry day
ted_01114_0663010_0664450 ms all right what is brand gerry
ted_01114_0665400_0666870 gerry unique ms unique
ted_01114_0666890_0672450 man i guess what kind of genre style i am would be like dark glamor
ted_01114_0672620_0676080 i like a lot of black colors a lot of grays and stuff like that
ted_01114_0676090_0682560 but usually i have an accessory like sunglasses or i like crystal and things like that too
ted_01114_0683120_0689380 woman if dan were a brand he might be a classic convertible mercedes benz
ted_01114_0689380_0694570 man 2 the brand that i am is i would call it casual fly
ted_01114_0694580_0698900 woman 2 part hippie part yogi part brooklyn girl i don &apos;t know
ted_01114_0698940_0699740 man 3 i &apos;m the pet guy
ted_01114_0699930_0702910 i sell pet toys all over the country all over the world
ted_01114_0702930_0704200 so i guess that &apos;s my brand
ted_01114_0704200_0707410 in my warped little industry that &apos;s my brand
ted_01114_0707870_0710580 man 4 my brand is fedex because i deliver the goods
ted_01114_0710780_0714390 man 5 failed writeralcoholic brand is that something
ted_01114_0715140_0718880 lawyer i &apos;m a lawyer brand
ted_01114_0719050_0721520 tom i &apos;m tom
ted_01114_0722220_0729030 ms well we can &apos;t all be brand tom but i do often find myself at the intersection of dark glamor and casual fly
ted_01114_0731325_0731525 laughter
ted_01114_0731450_0733060 and what i realized is i needed an expert
ted_01114_0733080_0741550 i needed somebody who could get inside my head somebody who could really help me understand what they call your brand personality and so i found a company called olson zaltman in pittsburg
ted_01114_0741840_0746540 they &apos;ve helped companies like nestle febreze hallmark discover that brand personality
ted_01114_0746550_0748850 if they could do it for them surely they could do it for me
ted_01114_0749660_0750760 video abigail you brought your pictures right
ted_01114_0750940_0755150 ms i did the very first picture is a picture of my family
ted_01114_0755350_0758230 a so tell me a little bit how it relates to your thoughts and feelings about who you are
ted_01114_0758400_0760880 ms these are the people who shape the way i look at the world
ted_01114_0760880_0762280 a tell me about this world
ted_01114_0762560_0770060 ms this world i think your world is the world that you live in like people who are around you your friends your family the way you live your life the job you do
ted_01114_0770650_0775250 all those things stemmed and started from one place and for me they stemmed and started with my family in west virginia
ted_01114_0775270_0776100 a what &apos;s the next one you want to talk about
ted_01114_0776100_0779160 ms the next one this was the best day ever
ted_01114_0779170_0780100 a how does this relate to your thoughts and feelings about who you are
ted_01114_0780390_0789890 a tell me about the why phase what does that do for us
ted_01114_0789950_0790650 what is the machete
ted_01114_0790680_0792070 what pupa stage are you in now
ted_01114_0792310_0792650 why is it important to reboot
ted_01114_0793020_0794340 what does the red represent
ted_01114_0794810_0796720 tell me a little bit about that part
ted_01114_0796730_0797830 a little more about you that is not who you are
ted_01114_0799490_0800800 what are some other metamorphoses that you &apos;ve had
ted_01114_0800970_0801650 doesn &apos;t have to be fear
ted_01114_0801690_0801930 what kind of roller coaster are you on
ted_01114_0801930_0805270 ms eeeeee a thank you no thank you
ted_01114_0805280_0806760 a thanks for you patience ms great job
ted_01114_0806760_0808510 a yeah ms thanks a lot all right
ted_01114_0808570_0811430 ms yeah i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to come of this
ted_01114_0812000_0813760 there was a whole lot of crazy going on in there
ted_01114_0814280_0824420 lindsay zaltman the first thing we saw was this idea that you had two distinct but complementary sides to your brand personality the morgan spurlock brand is a mindful play brand
ted_01114_0824650_0827070 those are juxtaposed very nicely together
ted_01114_0827070_0828820 and i think there &apos;s almost a paradox with those
ted_01114_0828830_0835260 and i think some companies will just focus on one of their strengths or the other instead of focusing on both
ted_01114_0835280_0846810 most companies tend to and it &apos;s human nature to avoid things that they &apos;re not sure of avoid fear those elements and you really embrace those and you actually turn them into positives for you and it &apos;s a neat thing to see
ted_01114_0846830_0848080 what other brands are like that
ted_01114_0848560_0850570 the first on here is the classic apple
ted_01114_0850950_0857060 and you can see here too target wii mini from the mini coopers and jetblue
ted_01114_0857120_0864110 now there &apos;s playful brands and mindful brands those things that have come and gone but a playful mindful brand is a pretty powerful thing
ted_01114_0864530_0866060 ms a playful mindful brand
ted_01114_0866060_0866770 what is your brand
ted_01114_0866770_0870440 if somebody asked you to describe your brand identity your brand personality what would you be
ted_01114_0870770_0872100 are you an up attribute
ted_01114_0872440_0874530 are you something that gets the blood flowing
ted_01114_0874900_0876280 or are you more of a down attribute
ted_01114_0876280_0879370 are you something that &apos;s a little more calm reserved conservative
ted_01114_0879750_0893860 up attributes are things like being playful being fresh like the fresh prince contemporary adventurous edgy or daring like errol flynn nimble or agile profane domineering magical or mystical like gandalf
ted_01114_0894620_0896090 or are you more of a down attribute
ted_01114_0896450_0898680 are you mindful sophisticated like 007
ted_01114_0898680_0903300 are you established traditional nurturing protective empathetic like the oprah
ted_01114_0903770_0911850 are you reliable stable familiar safe secure sacred contemplative or wise like the dalai lama or yoda
ted_01114_0912770_0920510 over the course of this film we had 500plus companies who were up and down companies saying no they didn &apos;t want any part of this project
ted_01114_0920520_0925360 they wanted nothing to do with this film mainly because they would have no control they would have no control over the final product
ted_01114_0925360_0941930 but we did get 17 brand partners who were willing to relinquish that control who wanted to be in business with someone as mindful and as playful as myself and who ultimately empowered us to tell stories that normally we wouldn &apos;t be able to tell stories that an advertiser would normally never get behind
ted_01114_0942670_0954220 they enabled us to tell the story about neuromarketing as we got into telling the story in this film about how now they &apos;re using mri &apos;s to target the desire centers of your brain for both commercials as well as movie marketing
ted_01114_0954840_0957570 we went to san paulo where they have banned outdoor advertising
ted_01114_0957570_0970230 in the entire city for the past five years there &apos;s no billboards there &apos;s no posters there &apos;s no flyers nothing applause and we went to school districts where now companies are making their way into cashstrapped schools all across america
ted_01114_0972150_0978470 what &apos;s incredible for me is the projects that i &apos;ve gotten the most feedback out of or i &apos;ve had the most success in are ones where i &apos;ve interacted with things directly
ted_01114_0978470_0985520 and that &apos;s what these brands did they cut out the middleman they cut out their agencies and said maybe these agencies don &apos;t have my best interest in mind
ted_01114_0985880_0987730 i &apos;m going to deal directly with the artist
ted_01114_0987940_0993220 i &apos;m going to work with him to create something different something that &apos;s going to get people thinking that &apos;s going to challenge the way we look at the world
ted_01114_0993700_0994850 and how has that been for them
ted_01114_0994910_0995910 has it been successful
ted_01114_0996240_0999060 well since the film premiered at the sundance film festival let &apos;s take a look
ted_01114_0999360_1007020 according to burrelles the movie premiered in january and since then and this isn &apos;t even the whole thing we &apos;ve had 900 million media impressions for this film
ted_01114_1007320_1009330 that &apos;s literally covering just like a two and a halfweek period
ted_01114_1009400_1011760 that &apos;s only online no print no tv
ted_01114_1011980_1013470 the film hasn &apos;t even been distributed yet
ted_01114_1013470_1014510 it &apos;s not even online
ted_01114_1014510_1015600 it &apos;s not even streaming
ted_01114_1015600_1017900 it &apos;s not even been out into other foreign countries yet
ted_01114_1018480_1022890 so ultimately this film has already started to gain a lot of momentum
ted_01114_1023200_1028240 and not bad for a project that almost every ad agency we talked to advised their clients not to take part
ted_01114_1029160_1034830 what i always believe is that if you take chances if you take risks that in those risks will come opportunity
ted_01114_1035220_1039220 i believe that when you push people away from that you &apos;re pushing them more towards failure
ted_01114_1039980_1046320 i believe that when you train your employees to be risk averse then you &apos;re preparing your whole company to be reward challenged
ted_01114_1047050_1051600 i feel like that what has to happen moving forward is we need to encourage people to take risks
ted_01114_1051940_1055410 we need to encourage people to not be afraid of opportunities that may scare them
ted_01114_1055790_1058760 ultimately moving forward i think we have to embrace fear
ted_01114_1059260_1074590 we &apos;ve got to put that bear in a cage laughter embrace fear embrace risk one big spoonful at a time we have to embrace risk
ted_01114_1074590_1077400 and ultimately we have to embrace transparency
ted_01114_1079190_1082910 today more than ever a little honesty is going to go a long way
ted_01114_1082910_1112820 and that being said through honesty and transparency my entire talk embrace transparency has been brought to you by my good friends at emc who for 7100 bought the naming rights on ebay applause emc turning big data into big opportunity for organizations all over the world
ted_01114_1112820_1114910 emc presents embrace transparency
ted_01114_1115210_1117030 thank you very much guys
ted_01114_1131415_1131615 applause
ted_01114_1131540_1138050 june cohen so morgan in the name of transparency what exactly happened to that 7100
ted_01114_1138050_1139450 ms that is a fantastic question
ted_01114_1141470_1152420 i have in my pocket a check made out to the parent organization to the ted organization the sapling foundation a check for 7100 to be applied toward my attendance for next year &apos;s ted
ted_01114_1152415_1152615 laughter
ted_01114_1152610_1164670 applause
ted_01115_0012760_0016860 i have had the distinct blessing in my life to have worked on a bunch of amazing projects
ted_01115_0016860_0021610 but the coolest i ever worked on was around this guy
ted_01115_0021680_0022810 this guy &apos;s name is tempt
ted_01115_0023250_0026270 tempt was one of the foremost graffiti artists in the 80s
ted_01115_0026660_0031820 and he came up home from a run one day and said dad my legs are tingling and that was the onset of als
ted_01115_0032430_0034600 so tempt is now completely paralyzed
ted_01115_0034620_0036970 he only has use of his eyes
ted_01115_0037440_0038550 i was exposed to him
ted_01115_0039290_0050830 i have a company that does design and animation so obviously graffiti is definitely an intricate part of what we admire and respect in the art world and so we decided that we were going to sponsor tony tempt and his cause
ted_01115_0050840_0055530 so i went and met with his brother and father and said we &apos;re going to give you this money
ted_01115_0055940_0060770 what are you going to do with it and his brother said i just want to be able to talk to tony again
ted_01115_0060860_0078120 i just want to be able to communicate with him and him to be able to communicate with me and i said wait a second isn &apos;t that i &apos;ve seen stephen hawking don &apos;t all paralyzed people have the ability to communicate via these devices and he said no unless you &apos;re in the upper echelon and you &apos;ve got really amazing insurance you can &apos;t actually do that
ted_01115_0078160_0087900 these devices aren &apos;t accessible to people and i said well how do you actually communicate has everyone seen the movie the diving bell and the butterfly that &apos;s how they communicate so run their finger along
ted_01115_0087900_0089260 i said that &apos;s archaic
ted_01115_0089260_0090140 how can that be
ted_01115_0090680_0099560 so i showed up with the desire to just write a check and instead i wrote a check that i had no freaking idea how i was going to cash
ted_01115_0100320_0108960 i committed to his brother and his father right then and there i &apos;m like all right here &apos;s the deal tony &apos;s going to speak we &apos;re going to get him a machine and we &apos;re going to figure out a way for him to do his art again
ted_01115_0108970_0113890 because it &apos;s a travesty that someone who still has all of that in him isn &apos;t able to communicate it
ted_01115_0114530_0116580 so i spoke at a conference a couple months after that
ted_01115_0116940_0128520 i met these guys called grl graffiti research lab and they have a technology that allows them to project a light onto any surface and then with a laser pointer draw on it and it just registers the negative space
ted_01115_0128530_0131550 so they go around and do art installations like this
ted_01115_0132170_0134390 all the things that go up there they said there &apos;s a life cycle
ted_01115_0134470_0144930 first it starts with the sexual organs then it starts with cuss words then it was bush slanders and then people actually got to art but there was always a life cycle to their presentations
ted_01115_0146820_0160630 so i went home and was having dinner with my wife and was telling her about this and we were like well wait a second if we know that this technology exists where you can use your eyes to control things why don &apos;t we figure out a way for tempt to control a laser and he could do graf again well that would be awesome
ted_01115_0160990_0162270 so that started the journey
ted_01115_0162350_0171600 and about two years later about a year later after a bunch of organization and a bunch of moving things around we &apos;d accomplished a couple things
ted_01115_0171600_0183080 one we battered down the doors of the insurance companies and we actually got tempt a machine that let him communicate a stephen hawking machine applause which was awesome
ted_01115_0183080_0189120 and he &apos;s seriously one of the funniest i call him yoda because you talk to the guy you get an email from him and you &apos;re like i &apos;m not worthy
ted_01115_0189140_0190250 this guy &apos;s so amazing
ted_01115_0190850_0197770 the other thing we did is we flew seven programmers from all over the world literally every corner of the world into our house
ted_01115_0198140_0206620 my wife and kids and i moved to our back garage and these hackers and programmers and conspiracy theorists and anarchists took over our house
ted_01115_0206660_0213510 a lot of our friends thought we were absolutely stupid to do that and that we were going to come back and all the pictures on the wall would be removed and graf on the walls
ted_01115_0214350_0226980 but for over two weeks we programmed we went to the venice boardwalk my kids got involved my dog got involved and we created this
ted_01115_0227460_0231160 this is called the eyewriter and you can see the description
ted_01115_0231670_0239640 this is a cheap pair of sunglasses that we bought at the venice beach boardwalk some copper wire and some stuff from home depot and radio shack
ted_01115_0240240_0251670 we took a ps3 camera hacked it open mounted it to an led light and now there &apos;s a device that is free you build this yourself we publish the code for free you download the software for free
ted_01115_0252010_0255830 and now we &apos;ve created a device that has absolutely no limitations
ted_01115_0256050_0265310 there &apos;s no insurance company that can say no there &apos;s no hospital that can say no anybody who &apos;s paralyzed now has access to actually draw or communicate using only their eyes
ted_01115_0275090_0275290 applause
ted_01115_0276030_0282780 thank you thank you guys very much that was awesome
ted_01115_0283470_0289200 so at the end of the two weeks we went back to tempt &apos;s room
ted_01115_0289610_0292630 i love this picture because this is someone else &apos;s room and that &apos;s his room
ted_01115_0292630_0295220 so there &apos;s all this hustle and bustle going on for the big unveiling
ted_01115_0295790_0305270 and after over a year of planning two weeks of programming carbfest and allnight sessions tony drew again for the first time in seven years
ted_01115_0305570_0311410 and this is an amazing picture because this is his life support system and he &apos;s looking over his life support system
ted_01115_0311410_0313590 we kicked his bed so that he could see out
ted_01115_0313830_0318330 and we set up a projector on a wall out in the parking lot outside of his hospital
ted_01115_0318600_0326550 and he drew again for the first time in front of his family and friends and you can only imagine what the feeling in the parking lot was
ted_01115_0326670_0330970 the funny thing was we had to break into the parking lot too so we totally felt like we were legit in the whole graf scene too
ted_01115_0330965_0331165 laughter
ted_01115_0333630_0341280 so at the end of this he sent us an email and this is what the email said that was the first time i &apos;ve drawn anything for seven years
ted_01115_0342120_0349330 i feel like i had been held underwater and someone finally reached down and pulled my head up so i could breathe isn &apos;t that awesome
ted_01115_0352505_0352705 applause
ted_01115_0352830_0355700 so that &apos;s kind of our battle cry
ted_01115_0355770_0358260 that &apos;s what keeps us going and keeps us developing
ted_01115_0358260_0360280 and we &apos;ve got such a long way to go with this
ted_01115_0361430_0364380 this is an amazing device but it &apos;s the equivalent of an etch a sketch
ted_01115_0364400_0367540 and someone who has that kind of artistic potential deserves so much more
ted_01115_0367540_0371640 so we &apos;re in the process of trying to figure out how to make it better faster stronger
ted_01115_0372350_0375490 since that time we &apos;ve had all kinds of acknowledgment
ted_01115_0375790_0376970 we &apos;ve won a bunch of awards
ted_01115_0377090_0379410 remember it &apos;s free none of us are making any money on this thing
ted_01115_0379410_0380490 it &apos;s all coming out of our own pockets
ted_01115_0380500_0389310 so the awards were like oh this is fantastic armstrong twittered about us and then in december time magazine honored us as one of the top 50 inventions of 2010 which was really cool
ted_01115_0389255_0389455 applause
ted_01115_0392230_0411640 the coolest thing about this and this is what &apos;s completing the whole circle is that in april of this year at the geffen moca in downtown los angeles there &apos;s going to be an exhibition called art of the streets and art of the streets is going to have pretty much the badasses of the street art scene banksy shepard fairey kaws all of these guys will be there
ted_01115_0412910_0415710 tempt &apos;s going to be in the show which is pretty awesome
ted_01115_0415635_0415835 applause
ted_01115_0418580_0426140 so basically this is my point if you see something that &apos;s not possible make it possible
ted_01115_0426390_0433240 everything in this room wasn &apos;t possible this stage this computer this mic the eyewriter wasn &apos;t possible at one point
ted_01115_0433550_0435380 make it possible everyone in this room
ted_01115_0435430_0444560 i &apos;m not a programmer never done anything with ocular recognition technology but i just recognized something and associated myself with amazing people so that we could make something happen
ted_01115_0444720_0452580 and this is the question i want everyone to ask yourself every single day when you come up with something you feel that needs to be done if not now then when
ted_01115_0453060_0454300 and if not me then who
ted_01115_0454970_0455410 thank you guys
ted_01115_0459855_0460055 applause
ted_01131_0012790_0015630 how would you like to be better than you are
ted_01131_0016800_0026210 suppose i said that with just a few changes in your genes you could get a better memory more precise more accurate and quicker
ted_01131_0027170_0031230 or maybe you &apos;d like to be more fit stronger with more stamina
ted_01131_0032290_0035040 would you like to be more attractive and selfconfident
ted_01131_0036230_0038640 how about living longer with good health
ted_01131_0039810_0044120 or perhaps you &apos;re one of those who &apos;s always yearned for more creativity
ted_01131_0044290_0046910 which one would you like the most
ted_01131_0048560_0053130 which would you like if you could have just one audience member creativity creativity
ted_01131_0054610_0062410 how many people would choose creativity raise your hands let me see a few probably about as many as there are creative people here laughter that &apos;s very good
ted_01131_0063750_0065210 how many would opt for memory
ted_01131_0067310_0075620 quite a few more how about fitness a few less what about longevity ah the majority
ted_01131_0075620_0077490 that makes me feel very good as a doctor
ted_01131_0078260_0082550 if you could have any one of these it would be a very different world
ted_01131_0083110_0088220 is it just imaginary or is it perhaps possible
ted_01131_0088970_0097590 evolution has been a perennial topic here at the ted conference but i want to give you today one doctor &apos;s take on the subject
ted_01131_0098790_0147800 the great 20thcentury geneticist tg dobzhansky who was also a communicant in the russian orthodox church once wrote an essay that he titled nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution now if you are one of those who does not accept the evidence for biological evolution this would be a very good time to turn off your hearing aid take out your personal communications device i give you permission and perhaps take another look at kathryn schultz &apos;s book on being wrong because nothing in the rest of this talk is going to make any sense whatsoever to you laughter but if you do accept biological evolution consider this is it just about the past or is it about the future
ted_01131_0147820_0152750 does it apply to others or does it apply to us
ted_01131_0153460_0155790 this is another look at the tree of life
ted_01131_0156380_0176580 in this picture i &apos;ve put a bush with a center branching out in all directions because if you look at the edges of the tree of life every existing species at the tips of those branches has succeeded in evolutionary terms it has survived it has demonstrated a fitness to its environment
ted_01131_0177950_0186870 the human part of this branch way out on one end is of course the one that we are most interested in
ted_01131_0187230_0194310 we branch off of a common ancestor to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago
ted_01131_0194850_0200940 in the interval there have been perhaps 20 or 25 different species of hominids
ted_01131_0201770_0203840 some have come and gone
ted_01131_0204140_0207680 we have been here for about 130000 years
ted_01131_0207910_0220980 it may seem like we &apos;re quite remote from other parts of this tree of life but actually for the most part the basic machinery of our cells is pretty much the same
ted_01131_0221240_0232440 do you realize that we can take advantage and commandeer the machinery of a common bacterium to produce the protein of human insulin used to treat diabetics
ted_01131_0232500_0241930 this is not like human insulin this is the same protein that is chemically indistinguishable from what comes out of your pancreas
ted_01131_0243150_0252650 and speaking of bacteria do you realize that each of us carries in our gut more bacteria than there are cells in the rest of our body
ted_01131_0252990_0254280 maybe 10 times more
ted_01131_0254630_0261480 i mean think of it when antonio damasio asks about your selfimage do you think about the bacteria
ted_01131_0263380_0267300 our gut is a wonderfully hospitable environment for those bacteria
ted_01131_0267310_0270890 it &apos;s warm it &apos;s dark it &apos;s moist it &apos;s very cozy
ted_01131_0271220_0275560 and you &apos;re going to provide all the nutrition that they could possibly want with no effort on their part
ted_01131_0275560_0283710 it &apos;s really like an easy street for bacteria with the occasional interruption of the unintended forced rush to the exit
ted_01131_0283730_0292870 but otherwise you are a wonderful environment for those bacteria just as they are essential to your life
ted_01131_0292900_0298590 they help in the digestion of essential nutrients and they protect you against certain diseases
ted_01131_0299910_0301860 but what will come in the future
ted_01131_0301950_0306350 are we at some kind of evolutionary equipoise as a species
ted_01131_0306570_0314820 or are we destined to become something different something perhaps even better adapted to the environment
ted_01131_0316110_0344480 now let &apos;s take a step back in time to the big bang 14 billion years ago the earth the solar system about four and a half billion years the first signs of protolife maybe three to four billion years ago on earth the first multicelled organisms perhaps as much as 800 or a billion years ago and then the human species finally emerging in the last 130000 years
ted_01131_0344490_0366880 in this vast unfinished symphony of the universe life on earth is like a brief measure the animal kingdom like a single measure and human life a small grace note that was us that also constitutes the entertainment portion of this talk so i hope you enjoyed it
ted_01131_0368570_0368770 laughter
ted_01131_0369110_0374470 now when i was a freshman in college i took my first biology class
ted_01131_0374810_0379030 i was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology
ted_01131_0379080_0396000 i became enamored of the power of evolution and i realized something very fundamental in most of the existence of life in singlecelled organisms each cell simply divides and all of the genetic energy of that cell is carried on in both daughter cells
ted_01131_0396440_0402100 but at the time multicelled organisms come online things start to change
ted_01131_0402210_0405030 sexual reproduction enters the picture
ted_01131_0405930_0415900 and very importantly with the introduction of sexual reproduction that passes on the genome the rest of the body becomes expendable
ted_01131_0416240_0427960 in fact you could say that the inevitability of the death of our bodies enters in evolutionary time at the same moment as sexual reproduction
ted_01131_0428640_0443520 now i have to confess when i was a college undergraduate i thought okay sex death sex death death for sex it seemed pretty reasonable at the time but with each passing year i &apos;ve come to have increasing doubts
ted_01131_0443520_0449830 i &apos;ve come to understand the sentiments of george burns who was performing still in las vegas well into his 90s
ted_01131_0450120_0457790 and one night there &apos;s a knock at his hotel room door he answers the door standing before him is a gorgeous scantily clad showgirl
ted_01131_0458000_0465200 she looks at him and says i &apos;m here for super sex that &apos;s fine says george i &apos;ll take the soup
ted_01131_0466445_0466645 laughter
ted_01131_0469450_0482530 i came to realize as a physician that i was working toward a goal which was different from the goal of evolution not necessarily contradictory just different
ted_01131_0482550_0484540 i was trying to preserve the body
ted_01131_0484690_0486590 i wanted to keep us healthy
ted_01131_0486620_0489220 i wanted to restore health from disease
ted_01131_0489230_0492080 i wanted us to live long and healthy lives
ted_01131_0492200_0514010 evolution is all about passing on the genome to the next generation adapting and surviving through generation after generation from an evolutionary point of view you and i are like the booster rockets designed to send the genetic payload into the next level of orbit and then drop off into the sea
ted_01131_0514350_0521320 i think we would all understand the sentiment that woody allen expressed when he said i don &apos;t want to achieve immortality through my work
ted_01131_0521340_0523590 i want to achieve it through not dying
ted_01131_0523555_0523755 laughter
ted_01131_0526640_0530720 evolution does not necessarily favor the longestlived
ted_01131_0531200_0536890 it doesn &apos;t necessarily favor the biggest or the strongest or the fastest and not even the smartest
ted_01131_0536910_0544100 evolution favors those creatures best adapted to their environment
ted_01131_0544390_0548400 that is the sole test of survival and success
ted_01131_0548610_0566220 at the bottom of the ocean bacteria that are thermophilic and can survive at the steam vent heat that would otherwise produce if fish were there sousvide cooked fish nevertheless have managed to make that a hospitable environment for them
ted_01131_0567020_0589060 so what does this mean as we look back at what has happened in evolution and as we think about the place again of humans in evolution and particularly as we look ahead to the next phase i would say that there are a number of possibilities
ted_01131_0589520_0593720 the first is that we will not evolve
ted_01131_0594660_0597620 we have reached a kind of equipoise
ted_01131_0598250_0609140 and the reasoning behind that would be first we have through medicine managed to preserve a lot of genes that would otherwise be selected out and be removed from the population
ted_01131_0609400_0619870 and secondly we as a species have so configured our environment that we have managed to make it adapt to us as well as we adapt to it
ted_01131_0620120_0631490 and by the way we immigrate and circulate and intermix so much that you can &apos;t any longer have the isolation that is necessary for evolution to take place
ted_01131_0632160_0640890 a second possibility is that there will be evolution of the traditional kind natural imposed by the forces of nature
ted_01131_0641600_0648540 and the argument here would be that the wheels of evolution grind slowly but they are inexorable
ted_01131_0649180_0661490 and as far as isolation goes when we as a species do colonize distant planets there will be the isolation and the environmental changes that could produce evolution in the natural way
ted_01131_0662230_0667990 but there &apos;s a third possibility an enticing intriguing and frightening possibility
ted_01131_0668010_0681290 i call it neoevolution the new evolution that is not simply natural but guided and chosen by us as individuals in the choices that we will make
ted_01131_0681920_0684000 now how could this come about
ted_01131_0684560_0687110 how could it be possible that we would do this
ted_01131_0687220_0696250 consider first the reality that people today in some cultures are making choices about their offspring
ted_01131_0696730_0700970 they &apos;re in some cultures choosing to have more males than females
ted_01131_0701310_0706520 it &apos;s not necessarily good for the society but it &apos;s what the individual and the family are choosing
ted_01131_0708130_0724800 think also if it were possible ever for you to choose not simply to choose the sex of your child but for you in your body to make the genetic adjustments that would cure or prevent diseases
ted_01131_0724800_0734060 what if you could make the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate stroke
ted_01131_0734160_0739890 wouldn &apos;t you want to make those changes in your genes
ted_01131_0740850_0748390 if we look ahead these kind of changes are going to be increasingly possible
ted_01131_0749340_0755620 the human genome project started in 1990 and it took 13 years
ted_01131_0755940_0759190 it cost 27 billion dollars
ted_01131_0760650_0768080 the year after it was finished in 2004 you could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three to four months
ted_01131_0768590_0777230 today you can have a complete sequence of the three billion base pairs in the human genome at a cost of about 20000 dollars and in the space of about a week
ted_01131_0777230_0785980 it won &apos;t be very long before the reality will be the 1000dollar human genome and it will be increasingly available for everyone
ted_01131_0785990_0837960 just a week ago the national academy of engineering awarded its draper prize to francis arnold and willem stemmer two scientists who independently developed techniques to encourage the natural process of evolution to work faster and to lead to desirable proteins in a more efficient way what frances arnold calls directed evolution a couple of years ago the lasker prize was awarded to the scientist shinya yamanaka for his research in which he took an adult skin cell a fibroblast and by manipulating just four genes he induced that cell to revert to a pluripotential stem cell a cell potentially capable of becoming any cell in your body
ted_01131_0839550_0852720 these changes are coming the same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that will not only protect you against themselves but induce immunity against other viruses
ted_01131_0852760_0862690 believe it or not there &apos;s an experimental trial going on with vaccine against influenza that has been grown in the cells of a tobacco plant
ted_01131_0863600_0865960 can you imagine something good coming out of tobacco
ted_01131_0867270_0873360 these are all reality today and in the future will be evermore possible
ted_01131_0873560_0877910 imagine then just two other little changes
ted_01131_0878100_0883980 you can change the cells in your body but what if you could change the cells in your offspring
ted_01131_0884140_0897370 what if you could change the sperm and the ova or change the newly fertilized egg and give your offspring a better chance at a healthier life eliminate the diabetes eliminate the hemophilia reduce the risk of cancer
ted_01131_0897570_0899600 who doesn &apos;t want healthier children
ted_01131_0900180_0919410 and then that same analytic technology that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent disease will also enable us to adopt superattributes hypercapacities that better memory
ted_01131_0919410_0927070 why not have the quick wit of a ken jennings especially if you can augment it with the next generation of the watson machine
ted_01131_0927820_0933110 why not have the quick twitch muscle that will enable you to run faster and longer
ted_01131_0933830_0936420 why not live longer
ted_01131_0937220_0939230 these will be irresistible
ted_01131_0939770_0954440 and when we are at a position where we can pass it on to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes we want we will have converted oldstyle evolution into neoevolution
ted_01131_0954450_0963900 we &apos;ll take a process that normally might require 100000 years and we can compress it down to a thousand years and maybe even in the next 100 years
ted_01131_0963900_0972390 these are choices that your grandchildren or their grandchildren are going to have before them
ted_01131_0973330_0982020 will we use these choices to make a society that is better that is more successful that is kinder
ted_01131_0982300_0989590 or will we selectively choose different attributes that we want for some of us and not for others of us
ted_01131_0989950_0998310 will we make a society that is more boring and more uniform or more robust and more versatile
ted_01131_0998590_1002160 these are the kinds of questions that we will have to face
ted_01131_1002160_1012750 and most profoundly of all will we ever be able to develop the wisdom and to inherit the wisdom that we &apos;ll need to make these choices wisely
ted_01131_1012780_1019530 for better or worse and sooner than you may think these choices will be up to us
ted_01131_1020050_1032980 thank you
ted_01131_1032905_1033105 applause
ted_01137_0012920_0038850 good afternoon everybody i &apos;ve got something to show you laughter think about this as a pixel a flying pixel
ted_01137_0040120_0042950 this is what we call in our lab sensible design
ted_01137_0043060_0044120 let me tell you a bit about it
ted_01137_0044540_0058740 now if you take this picture i &apos;m italian originally and every boy in italy grows up with this picture on the wall of his bedroom but the reason i &apos;m showing you this is that something very interesting happened in formula 1 racing over the past couple of decades
ted_01137_0059220_0067320 now some time ago if you wanted to win a formula 1 race you take a budget and you bet your budget on a good driver and a good car
ted_01137_0067880_0071050 and if the car and the driver were good enough then you &apos;d win the race
ted_01137_0071400_0094850 now today if you want to win the race actually you need also something like this something that monitors the car in real time has a few thousand sensors collecting information from the car transmitting this information into the system and then processing it and using it in order to go back to the car with decisions and changing things in real time as information is collected
ted_01137_0095350_0100020 this is what in engineering terms you would call a real time control system
ted_01137_0100200_0105770 and basically it &apos;s a system made of two components a sensing and an actuating component
ted_01137_0106280_0112230 what is interesting today is that real time control systems are starting to enter into our lives
ted_01137_0112580_0119110 our cities over the past few years just have been blanketed with networks electronics
ted_01137_0119310_0121560 they &apos;re becoming like computers in open air
ted_01137_0121980_0128170 and as computers in open air they &apos;re starting to respond in a different way to be able to be sensed and to be actuated
ted_01137_0128720_0130670 if we fix cities actually it &apos;s a big deal
ted_01137_0130680_0138690 just as an aside i wanted to mention cities are only two percent of the earth &apos;s crust but they are 50 percent of the world &apos;s population
ted_01137_0139000_0144880 they are 75 percent of the energy consumption up to 80 percent of co2 emissions
ted_01137_0145300_0148200 so if we &apos;re able to do something with cities that &apos;s a big deal
ted_01137_0148740_0155050 beyond cities all of this sensing and actuating is entering our everyday objects
ted_01137_0155550_0161630 that &apos;s from an exhibition that paola antonelli is organizing at moma later this year during the summer
ted_01137_0161630_0166600 it &apos;s called talk to me well our objects our environment is starting to talk back to us
ted_01137_0166880_0173060 in a certain sense it &apos;s almost as if every atom out there were becoming both a sensor and an actuator
ted_01137_0173060_0178880 and that is radically changing the interaction we have as humans with the environment out there
ted_01137_0179160_0194830 in a certain sense it &apos;s almost as if the old dream of michelangelo you know when michelangelo sculpted the moses at the end it said that he took the hammer threw it at the moses actually you can still see a small chip underneath and said shouted perché non parli
ted_01137_0194980_0200000 why don &apos;t you talk well today for the first time our environment is starting to talk back to us
ted_01137_0200330_0205590 and i &apos;ll show just a few examples again with this idea of sensing our environment and actuating it
ted_01137_0206160_0213030 let &apos;s starting with sensing well the first project i wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects by our lab
ted_01137_0213070_0215830 it was four and a half years ago in italy
ted_01137_0216140_0232030 and what we did there was actually use a new type of network at the time that had been deployed all across the world that &apos;s a cellphone network and use anonymous and aggregated information from that network that &apos;s collected anyway by the operator in order to understand how the city works
ted_01137_0232450_0235360 the summer was a lucky summer 2006
ted_01137_0235710_0237750 it &apos;s when italy won the soccer world cup
ted_01137_0238590_0243110 some of you might remember it was italy and france playing and then zidane at the end the headbutt
ted_01137_0243110_0244760 and anyway italy won at the end
ted_01137_0245015_0245215 laughter
ted_01137_0245240_0253010 now look at what happened that day just by monitoring activity happening on the network
ted_01137_0253700_0254800 here you see the city
ted_01137_0255550_0261030 you see the colosseum in the middle the river tiber
ted_01137_0261040_0263110 it &apos;s morning before the match
ted_01137_0263620_0265120 you see the timeline on the top
ted_01137_0266260_0270220 early afternoon people here and there making calls and moving
ted_01137_0271560_0282820 the match begins silence france scores italy scores halftime people make a quick call and go to the bathroom second half end of normal time
ted_01137_0283270_0285300 first overtime second
ted_01137_0285760_0298540 zidane the headbutt in a moment italy wins yeah laughter applause well that night everybody went to celebrate in the center
ted_01137_0298540_0299430 you saw the big peak
ted_01137_0299450_0306040 the following day again everybody went to the center to meet the winning team and the prime minister at the time
ted_01137_0306250_0307560 and then everybody moved down
ted_01137_0307560_0315720 you see the image of the place called circo massimo where since roman times people go to celebrate to have a big party and you see the peak at the end of the day
ted_01137_0315800_0321760 well that &apos;s just one example of how we can sense the city today in a way that we couldn &apos;t have done just a few years ago
ted_01137_0322160_0328510 another quick example about sensing it &apos;s not about people but about things we use and consume
ted_01137_0328520_0332880 well today we know everything about where our objects come from
ted_01137_0333340_0338320 this is a map that shows you all the chips that form a mac computer how they came together
ted_01137_0338640_0341140 but we know very little about where things go
ted_01137_0341140_0348300 so in this project we actually developed some small tags to track trash as it moves through the system
ted_01137_0348580_0362900 so we actually started with a number of volunteers who helped us in seattle just over a year ago to tag what they were throwing away different types of things as you can see here things they would throw away anyway
ted_01137_0363480_0369000 then we put a little chip little tag onto the trash and then started following it
ted_01137_0369670_0371890 here are the results we just obtained
ted_01137_0371820_0372020 music
ted_01137_0375530_0384550 from seattle after one week
ted_01137_0410230_0413910 with this information we realized there &apos;s a lot of inefficiencies in the system
ted_01137_0413950_0416590 we can actually do the same thing with much less energy
ted_01137_0416980_0418720 this data was not available before
ted_01137_0418770_0422230 but there &apos;s a lot of wasted transportation and convoluted things happening
ted_01137_0422620_0430220 but the other thing is that we believe that if we see every day that the cup we &apos;re throwing away it doesn &apos;t disappear it &apos;s still somewhere on the planet
ted_01137_0430460_0433500 and the plastic bottle we &apos;re throwing away every day still stays there
ted_01137_0433910_0437210 and if we show that to people then we can also promote some behavioral change
ted_01137_0437450_0438850 so that was the reason for the project
ted_01137_0439130_0450420 my colleague at mit assaf biderman he could tell you much more about sensing and many other wonderful things we can do with sensing but i wanted to go to the second part we discussed at the beginning and that &apos;s actuating our environment
ted_01137_0450920_0455380 and the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in zaragoza spain
ted_01137_0455770_0466170 it started with a question by the mayor of the city who came to us saying that spain and southern europe have a beautiful tradition of using water in public space in architecture
ted_01137_0466570_0470540 and the question was how could technology new technology be added to that
ted_01137_0470850_0479910 and one of the ideas that was developed at mit in a workshop was imagine this pipe and you &apos;ve got valves solenoid valves taps opening and closing
ted_01137_0479910_0483290 you create like a water curtain with pixels made of water
ted_01137_0483330_0488640 if those pixels fall you can write on it you can show patterns images text
ted_01137_0489020_0495180 and even you can approach it and it will open up to let you jump through as you see in this image
ted_01137_0495870_0497700 well we presented this to mayor belloch
ted_01137_0497950_0499030 he liked it very much
ted_01137_0499190_0502510 and we got a commission to design a building at the entrance of the expo
ted_01137_0503100_0504810 we called it digital water pavilion
ted_01137_0505560_0507060 the whole building is made of water
ted_01137_0511380_0532390 there &apos;s no doors or windows but when you approach it it will open up to let you in music the roof also is covered with water
ted_01137_0534850_0538610 and if there &apos;s a bit of wind if you want to minimize splashing you can actually lower the roof
ted_01137_0541050_0546950 or you could close the building and the whole architecture will disappear like in this case
ted_01137_0547600_0558870 you know these days you always get images during the winter when they take the roof down of people who have been there and said they demolished the building no they didn &apos;t demolish it just when it goes down the architecture almost disappears
ted_01137_0558920_0560580 here &apos;s the building working
ted_01137_0560650_0563900 you see the person puzzled about what was going on inside
ted_01137_0564370_0568750 and here was myself trying not to get wet testing the sensors that open the water
ted_01137_0569280_0573310 well i should tell you now what happened one night when all of the sensors stopped working
ted_01137_0574640_0577570 but actually that night it was even more fun
ted_01137_0577610_0582470 all the kids from zaragoza came to the building because the way of engaging with the building became something different
ted_01137_0582480_0603880 not anymore a building that would open up to let you in but a building that would still make cuts and holes through the water and you had to jump without getting wet
ted_01137_0603805_0604005 video crowd noise
ted_01137_0604100_0611670 and that was for us was very interesting because as architects as engineers as designers we always think about how people will use the things we design
ted_01137_0611940_0613820 but then reality &apos;s always unpredictable
ted_01137_0613850_0617780 and that &apos;s the beauty of doing things that are used and interact with people
ted_01137_0618060_0624900 here is an image then of the building with the physical pixels the pixels made of water and then projections on them
ted_01137_0625190_0628630 and this is what led us to think about the following project i &apos;ll show you now
ted_01137_0629030_0631720 that &apos;s imagine those pixels could actually start flying
ted_01137_0631800_0643420 imagine you could have small helicopters that move in the air and then each of them with a small pixel in changing lights almost as a cloud that can move in space here is the video
ted_01137_0643350_0643550 music
ted_01137_0650460_0662970 so imagine one helicopter like the one we saw before moving with others in synchrony
ted_01137_0663240_0664470 so you can have this cloud
ted_01137_0670980_0678780 you can have a kind of flexible screen or display like this a regular configuration in two dimensions
ted_01137_0686150_0692340 or in regular but in three dimensions where the thing that changes is the light not the pixels &apos; position
ted_01137_0692540_0705400 you can play with a different type
ted_01137_0705400_0712640 imagine your screen could just appear in different scales or sizes different types of resolution
ted_01137_0722440_0730910 but then the whole thing can be just a 3d cloud of pixels that you can approach and move through it and see from many many directions
ted_01137_0732610_0737880 here is the real flyfire control and going down to form the regular grid as before
ted_01137_0738060_0741110 when you turn on the light actually you see this so the same as we saw before
ted_01137_0741240_0743650 and imagine each of them then controlled by people
ted_01137_0743860_0749040 you can have each pixel having an input that comes from people from people &apos;s movement or so and so
ted_01137_0749280_0751200 i want to show you something here for the first time
ted_01137_0751480_0764290 we &apos;ve been working with roberto bolle one of today &apos;s top ballet dancers the étoile at metropolitan in new york and la scala in milan and actually captured his movement in 3d in order to use it as an input for flyfire
ted_01137_0764290_0766940 and here you can see roberto dancing
ted_01137_0771090_0774580 you see on the left the pixels the different resolutions being captured
ted_01137_0774840_0778250 it &apos;s both 3d scanning in real time and motion capture
ted_01137_0780190_0782330 so you can reconstruct a whole movement
ted_01137_0782340_0790950 you can go all the way through
ted_01137_0793540_0800290 but then once we have the pixels then you can play with them and play with color and movement and gravity and rotation
ted_01137_0801610_0804780 so we want to use this as one of the possible inputs for flyfire
ted_01137_0804780_0826370 i wanted to show you the last project we are working on
ted_01137_0826490_0828910 it &apos;s something we &apos;re working on for the london olympics
ted_01137_0829180_0830160 it &apos;s called the cloud
ted_01137_0830660_0841670 and the idea here is imagine again we can involve people in doing something and changing our environment almost to impart what we call cloud raising like barn raising but with a cloud
ted_01137_0841670_0844820 imagine you can have everybody make a small donation for one pixel
ted_01137_0845440_0854500 and i think what is remarkable that has happened over the past couple of years is that over the past couple of decades we went from the physical world to the digital one
ted_01137_0854660_0858620 this has been digitizing everything knowledge and making that accessible through the internet
ted_01137_0859020_0867730 now today for the first time and the obama campaign showed us this we can go from the digital world from the selforganizing power of networks to the physical one
ted_01137_0868610_0872420 this can be in our case we want to use it for designing and doing a symbol
ted_01137_0872450_0874270 that means something built in a city
ted_01137_0874700_0884030 but tomorrow it can be in order to tackle today &apos;s pressing challenges think about climate change or co2 emissions how we can go from the digital world to the physical one
ted_01137_0884250_0888500 so the idea that we can actually involve people in doing this thing together collectively
ted_01137_0888810_0895090 the cloud is a cloud again made of pixels in the same way as the real cloud is a cloud made of particles
ted_01137_0895270_0898960 and those particles are water where our cloud is a cloud of pixels
ted_01137_0899020_0901770 it &apos;s a physical structure in london but covered with pixels
ted_01137_0902020_0904610 you can move inside have different types of experiences
ted_01137_0904610_0914980 you can actually see from underneath sharing the main moments for the olympics in 2012 and beyond and really using it as a way to connect with the community
ted_01137_0915110_0924920 so both the physical cloud in the sky and something you can go to the top of like london &apos;s new mountaintop
ted_01137_0924930_0926150 you can enter inside it
ted_01137_0926570_0934440 and a kind of new digital beacon for the night but most importantly a new type of experience for anybody who will go to the top
ted_01137_0934860_0935870 thank you
ted_01137_0935795_0935995 applause
ted_01144_0012920_0025790 my name is amit and 18 months ago i had another job at google and i pitched this idea of doing something with museums and art to my boss who &apos;s actually here and she allowed me to do it
ted_01144_0025900_0027560 and it took 18 months
ted_01144_0027930_0033770 a lot of fun negotiations and stories i can tell you with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries
ted_01144_0034010_0035390 but i &apos;m going to focus on the demo
ted_01144_0036430_0039180 there are a lot of stories about why we did this
ted_01144_0039230_0043660 i think my personal story is explained very simply on the slide and it &apos;s access
ted_01144_0044000_0046120 and i grew up in india
ted_01144_0046530_0056980 i had a great education i &apos;m not complaining but i didn &apos;t have access to a lot of these museums and these artworks and so when i started traveling and going to these museums i started learning a lot
ted_01144_0057350_0064420 and while working at google i tried to put this desire to make it more accessible with technology together
ted_01144_0064700_0069350 so we formed a team a great team of people and we started doing this
ted_01144_0069360_0075000 i &apos;m going to probably get into the demo and then tell you a couple of the interesting things we &apos;ve had since launch
ted_01144_0075450_0081420 so simple you come to googleartprojectcom you look around at all these museums here
ted_01144_0081440_0085430 you &apos;ve got the uffizi you &apos;ve got the moma the hermitage the rijks the van gogh
ted_01144_0085850_0090750 i &apos;m going to actually get to one of my favorites the metropolitan museum of art in new york
ted_01144_0091540_0093940 two ways of going in very simple
ted_01144_0094370_0096870 click and bang you &apos;re in this museum
ted_01144_0096880_0100620 it doesn &apos;t matter where you are bombay mexico it doesn &apos;t really matter
ted_01144_0100920_0102460 you move around you have fun
ted_01144_0102660_0104370 you want to navigate around the museum
ted_01144_0104690_0107750 open the plan up and in one click jump
ted_01144_0108730_0113770 you &apos;re in there you want to go to the end of the corridor keep going have fun explore
ted_01144_0120325_0120525 applause
ted_01144_0120450_0121800 thanks i haven &apos;t come to the best part
ted_01144_0121725_0121925 laughter
ted_01144_0122190_0129390 so now i &apos;m in front of one of my favorite paintings the harvesters by pieter bruegel at the met
ted_01144_0129700_0130730 i see this plus sign
ted_01144_0130940_0133070 if the museum has given us the image you click on it
ted_01144_0133530_0134690 now this is one of the images
ted_01144_0134700_0136610 so this is all of the metadata information
ted_01144_0136640_0141530 for those of you who are truly interested in art you can click this but i &apos;m going to click this off right now
ted_01144_0142110_0145950 and this is one of these images that we captured in what we call gigapixel technology
ted_01144_0145950_0150040 so this image for example has close to i think around 10 billion pixels
ted_01144_0150120_0157010 and i get a lot of people asking me what do you get for 10 billion pixels so i &apos;m going to try and show you what you really get for 10 billion pixels
ted_01144_0157420_0159160 you can zoom around very simply
ted_01144_0159250_0161150 you see some fun stuff happening here
ted_01144_0161620_0164090 i love this guy his expression is priceless
ted_01144_0164460_0166760 but then you really want to go deep
ted_01144_0167150_0170890 and so i started playing around and i found something going on over here
ted_01144_0171260_0172650 and i was like hold on
ted_01144_0172700_0178700 that sounds interesting went in and i started noticing that these kids were actually beating something
ted_01144_0179530_0190240 i did a little research spoke to a couple of my contacts at the met and actually found out that this is a game called squall which involves beating a goose with a stick on shrove tuesday
ted_01144_0190560_0192440 and apparently it was quite popular
ted_01144_0192490_0195240 i don &apos;t know why they did it but i learned something about it
ted_01144_0195910_0199230 now just to get really deep in you can really get to the cracks
ted_01144_0199240_0203210 now just to give you some perspective i &apos;m going to zoom out so you really see what you get
ted_01144_0204540_0208250 here is where we were and this is the painting
ted_01144_0210325_0210525 applause
ted_01144_0210470_0219670 the best is yet to come so in a second
ted_01144_0220640_0225370 so now let &apos;s just quickly jump into the moma again in new york
ted_01144_0225670_0230670 so another one of my favorites the starry night now the example i showed you was all about finding details
ted_01144_0231040_0232720 but what if you want to see brush strokes
ted_01144_0232750_0238740 and what if you want to see how van gogh actually created this masterpiece you zoom in you really go in
ted_01144_0238740_0243180 i &apos;m going to go to one of my favorite parts in this painting and i &apos;m really going to get to the cracks
ted_01144_0244060_0249070 this is the starry night i think never seen like this before
ted_01144_0249720_0251440 i &apos;m going to show you my other favorite feature
ted_01144_0251440_0253310 there &apos;s a lot of other stuff here but i don &apos;t have time
ted_01144_0254120_0255420 this is the real cool part
ted_01144_0255510_0256620 it &apos;s called collections
ted_01144_0256910_0263730 any one of you anybody doesn &apos;t matter if you &apos;re rich if you &apos;re poor if you have a fancy house doesn &apos;t matter
ted_01144_0263730_0268050 you can go and create your own museum online create your own collection across all these images
ted_01144_0268330_0273940 very simply you go in and i &apos;ve created this called the power of zoom you can just zoom around
ted_01144_0274140_0277040 this is the ambassadors based in the national gallery
ted_01144_0277150_0284410 you can annotate the stuff send it to your friends and really get a conversation going about what you &apos;re feeling when you go through these masterpieces
ted_01144_0284980_0292180 so i think in conclusion for me the main thing is that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from google
ted_01144_0292280_0294530 it doesn &apos;t in my opinion even come from the museums
ted_01144_0294690_0295340 i probably shouldn &apos;t say that
ted_01144_0295980_0298000 it really comes from these artists
ted_01144_0299020_0301390 and that &apos;s been my humbling experience in this
ted_01144_0301410_0307650 i mean i hope in this digital medium that we do justice to their artwork and represent it properly online
ted_01144_0307920_0315990 and the biggest question i get asked nowadays is did you do this to replicate the experience of going to a museum and the answer is no
ted_01144_0316010_0318060 it &apos;s to supplement the experience
ted_01144_0318180_0319360 and that &apos;s it thank you
ted_01144_0322895_0323095 applause
ted_01144_0322955_0323155 thank you
ted_01160_0013530_0017660 this is a representation of your brain and your brain can be broken into two parts
ted_01160_0018240_0023410 there &apos;s the left half which is the logical side and then the right half which is the intuitive
ted_01160_0024140_0028990 and so if we had a scale to measure the aptitude of each hemisphere then we can plot our brain
ted_01160_0029330_0032330 and for example this would be somebody who &apos;s completely logical
ted_01160_0032680_0035140 this would be someone who &apos;s entirely intuitive
ted_01160_0036150_0038460 so where would you put your brain on this scale
ted_01160_0039090_0048870 some of us may have opted for one of these extremes but i think for most people in the audience your brain is something like this with a high aptitude in both hemispheres at the same time
ted_01160_0049180_0051060 it &apos;s not like they &apos;re mutually exclusive or anything
ted_01160_0051060_0053170 you can be logical and intuitive
ted_01160_0053720_0063040 and so i consider myself one of these people along with most of the other experimental quantum physicists who need a good deal of logic to string together these complex ideas
ted_01160_0063530_0068180 but at the same time we need a good deal of intuition to actually make the experiments work
ted_01160_0068770_0070160 how do we develop this intuition
ted_01160_0070160_0071340 well we like to play with stuff
ted_01160_0071350_0075780 so we go out and play with it and then we see how it acts and then we develop our intuition from there
ted_01160_0075780_0078770 and really you do the same thing
ted_01160_0079390_0086840 so some intuition that you may have developed over the years is that one thing is only in one place at a time
ted_01160_0087620_0096730 i mean it can sound weird to think about one thing being in two different places at the same time but you weren &apos;t born with this notion you developed it
ted_01160_0097430_0100010 and i remember watching a kid playing on a car stop
ted_01160_0100010_0103290 he was just a toddler and he wasn &apos;t very good at it and he kept falling over
ted_01160_0103380_0112060 but i bet playing with this car stop taught him a really valuable lesson and that &apos;s that large things don &apos;t let you get right past them and that they stay in one place
ted_01160_0113020_0118220 and so this is a great conceptual model to have of the world unless you &apos;re a particle physicist
ted_01160_0118450_0125060 it &apos;d be a terrible model for a particle physicist because they don &apos;t play with car stops they play with these little weird particles
ted_01160_0125490_0135090 and when they play with their particles they find they do all sorts of really weird things like they can fly right through walls or they can be in two different places at the same time
ted_01160_0136190_0142050 and so they wrote down all these observations and they called it the theory of quantum mechanics
ted_01160_0142690_0150550 and so that &apos;s where physics was at a few years ago you needed quantum mechanics to describe little tiny particles
ted_01160_0150700_0155700 but you didn &apos;t need it to describe the large everyday objects around us
ted_01160_0156260_0162120 this didn &apos;t really sit well with my intuition and maybe it &apos;s just because i don &apos;t play with particles very often
ted_01160_0162520_0165570 well i play with them sometimes but not very often
ted_01160_0166110_0167250 and i &apos;ve never seen them
ted_01160_0167640_0170120 i mean nobody &apos;s ever seen a particle
ted_01160_0171360_0173810 but it didn &apos;t sit well with my logical side either
ted_01160_0174080_0184150 because if everything is made up of little particles and all the little particles follow quantum mechanics then shouldn &apos;t everything just follow quantum mechanics
ted_01160_0186640_0188220 i don &apos;t see any reason why it shouldn &apos;t
ted_01160_0189170_0196480 and so i &apos;d feel a lot better about the whole thing if we could somehow show that an everyday object also follows quantum mechanics
ted_01160_0196960_0199680 so a few years ago i set off to do just that
ted_01160_0200920_0209940 so i made one this is the first object that you can see that has been in a mechanical quantum superposition
ted_01160_0210880_0213580 so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip
ted_01160_0213930_0217190 and you can sort of see this green dot right in the middle
ted_01160_0217270_0219720 and that &apos;s this piece of metal i &apos;m going to be talking about in a minute
ted_01160_0220060_0221980 this is a photograph of the object
ted_01160_0221980_0223280 and here i &apos;ll zoom in a little bit
ted_01160_0223550_0228210 we &apos;re looking right there in the center and then here &apos;s a really really big closeup of the little piece of metal
ted_01160_0228640_0233420 so what we &apos;re looking at is a little chunk of metal and it &apos;s shaped like a diving board and it &apos;s sticking out over a ledge
ted_01160_0233630_0237210 and so i made this thing in nearly the same way as you make a computer chip
ted_01160_0237220_0243740 i went into a clean room with a fresh silicon wafer and then i just cranked away at all the big machines for about 100 hours
ted_01160_0243990_0249370 for the last stuff i had to build my own machine to make this swimming poolshaped hole underneath the device
ted_01160_0250150_0256080 this device has the ability to be in a quantum superposition but it needs a little help to do it
ted_01160_0256470_0258020 here let me give you an analogy
ted_01160_0258500_0261140 you know how uncomfortable it is to be in a crowded elevator
ted_01160_0261450_0271240 i mean when i &apos;m in an elevator all alone i do all sorts of weird things but then other people get on board and i stop doing those things because i don &apos;t want to bother them or frankly scare them
ted_01160_0274690_0278160 so quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects feel the same way
ted_01160_0278540_0287290 the fellow passengers for inanimate objects are not just people but it &apos;s also the light shining on it and the wind blowing past it and the heat of the room
ted_01160_0287970_0294140 and so we knew if we wanted to see this piece of metal behave quantum mechanically we &apos;re going to have to kick out all the other passengers
ted_01160_0294530_0295400 and so that &apos;s what we did
ted_01160_0295980_0303950 we turned off the lights and then we put it in a vacuum and sucked out all the air and then we cooled it down to just a fraction of a degree above absolute zero
ted_01160_0304420_0309000 now all alone in the elevator the little chunk of metal is free to act however it wanted
ted_01160_0309250_0310380 and so we measured its motion
ted_01160_0310380_0312680 we found it was moving in really weird ways
ted_01160_0312910_0320690 instead of just sitting perfectly still it was vibrating and the way it was vibrating was breathing something like this like expanding and contracting bellows
ted_01160_0321090_0330640 and by giving it a gentle nudge we were able to make it both vibrate and not vibrate at the same time something that &apos;s only allowed with quantum mechanics
ted_01160_0331210_0333720 so what i &apos;m telling you here is something truly fantastic
ted_01160_0334570_0340390 what does it mean for one thing to be both vibrating and not vibrating at the same time
ted_01160_0340920_0342440 so let &apos;s think about the atoms
ted_01160_0342590_0352870 so in one case all the trillions of atoms that make up that chunk of metal are sitting still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down
ted_01160_0353640_0355700 now it &apos;s only at precise times when they align
ted_01160_0356010_0357650 the rest of the time they &apos;re delocalized
ted_01160_0358520_0367240 that means that every atom is in two different places at the same time which in turn means the entire chunk of metal is in two different places
ted_01160_0367420_0372000 i think this is really cool laughter really
ted_01160_0371935_0372135 applause
ted_01160_0376110_0390150 it was worth locking myself in a clean room to do this for all those years because check this out the difference in scale between a single atom and that chunk of metal is about the same as the difference between that chunk of metal and you
ted_01160_0390830_0398540 so if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time that chunk of metal can be in two different places then why not you
ted_01160_0398550_0401810 i mean this is just my logical side talking
ted_01160_0403220_0408760 so imagine if you &apos;re in multiple places at the same time what would that be like
ted_01160_0410230_0415540 how would your consciousness handle your body being delocalized in space
ted_01160_0417130_0418380 there &apos;s one more part to the story
ted_01160_0418380_0426290 it &apos;s when we warmed it up and we turned on the lights and looked inside the box we saw that the piece metal was still there in one piece
ted_01160_0427240_0437330 and so i had to develop this new intuition that it seems like all the objects in the elevator are really just quantum objects just crammed into a tiny space
ted_01160_0437860_0442190 you hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says that everything is all interconnected
ted_01160_0442870_0447250 well that &apos;s not quite right it &apos;s more than that it &apos;s deeper
ted_01160_0447710_0458120 it &apos;s that those connections your connections to all the things around you literally define who you are and that &apos;s the profound weirdness of quantum mechanics
ted_01160_0458730_0459040 thank you
ted_01160_0462555_0462755 applause
ted_01161_0012410_0015480 i &apos;m jessi and this is my suitcase
ted_01161_0015830_0025070 but before i show you what i &apos;ve got inside i &apos;m going to make a very public confession and that is i &apos;m outfitobsessed
ted_01161_0025560_0035360 i love finding wearing and more recently photographing and blogging a different colorful crazy outfit for every single occasion
ted_01161_0036050_0038310 but i don &apos;t buy anything new
ted_01161_0038910_0053780 i get all my clothes secondhand from flea markets and thrift stores aww thank you secondhand shopping allows me to reduce the impact my wardrobe has on the environment and on my wallet
ted_01161_0054080_0064610 i get to meet all kinds of great people my dollars usually go to a good cause i look pretty unique and it makes shopping like my own personal treasure hunt
ted_01161_0064620_0066360 i mean what am i going to find today
ted_01161_0066570_0067950 is it going to be my size
ted_01161_0068600_0068850 will i like the color
ted_01161_0068900_0072040 will it be under 20
ted_01161_0072060_0076440 if all the answers are yes i feel as though i &apos;ve won
ted_01161_0077340_0084220 i want to get back to my suitcase and tell you what i packed for this exciting week here at ted
ted_01161_0084980_0087600 i mean what does somebody with all these outfits bring with her
ted_01161_0087780_0090110 so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought
ted_01161_0091000_0096350 i brought seven pairs of underpants and that &apos;s it
ted_01161_0097490_0102860 exactly one week &apos;s worth of undies is all i put in my suitcase
ted_01161_0102890_0109740 i was betting that i &apos;d be able to find everything else i could possible want to wear once i got here to palm springs
ted_01161_0110260_0117810 and since you don &apos;t know me as the woman walking around ted in her underwear laughter that means i found a few things
ted_01161_0118200_0121470 and i &apos;d really love to show you my week &apos;s worth of outfits right now
ted_01161_0121470_0134600 does that sound good applause so as i do this i &apos;m also going to tell you a few of the life lessons that believe it or not i have picked up in these adventures wearing nothing new
ted_01161_0135010_0137120 so let &apos;s start with sunday
ted_01161_0137860_0142910 i call this shiny tiger you do not have to spend a lot of money to look great
ted_01161_0142940_0146010 you can almost always look phenomenal for under 50
ted_01161_0146010_0153380 this whole outfit including the jacket cost me 55 and it was the most expensive thing that i wore the entire week
ted_01161_0153380_0156330 monday color is powerful
ted_01161_0157680_0170660 it is almost physiologically impossible to be in a bad mood when you &apos;re wearing bright red pants laughter if you are happy you are going to attract other happy people to you
ted_01161_0171970_0176230 tuesday fitting in is way overrated
ted_01161_0176880_0181670 i &apos;ve spent a whole lot of my life trying to be myself and at the same time fit in
ted_01161_0182130_0190440 just be who you are if you are surrounding yourself with the right people they will not only get it they will appreciate it
ted_01161_0192080_0194800 wednesday embrace your inner child
ted_01161_0195170_0202240 sometimes people tell me that i look like i &apos;m playing dressup or that i remind them of their sevenyearold
ted_01161_0203280_0206340 i like to smile and say thank you
ted_01161_0207980_0210620 thursday confidence is key
ted_01161_0211180_0215380 if you think you look good in something you almost certainly do
ted_01161_0215620_0219370 and if you don &apos;t think you look good in something you &apos;re also probably right
ted_01161_0219910_0222780 i grew up with a mom who taught me this dayin and dayout
ted_01161_0223090_0227020 but it wasn &apos;t until i turned 30 that i really got what this meant
ted_01161_0227220_0229250 and i &apos;m going to break it down for you for just a second
ted_01161_0230640_0238500 if you believe you &apos;re a beautiful person inside and out there is no look that you can &apos;t pull off
ted_01161_0238830_0241590 so there is no excuse for any of us here in this audience
ted_01161_0241590_0245300 we should be able to rock anything we want to rock thank you
ted_01161_0245225_0245425 applause
ted_01161_0249080_0256030 friday a universal truth five words for you gold sequins go with everything
ted_01161_0257370_0267230 and finally saturday developing your own unique personal style is a really great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word
ted_01161_0267650_0275140 it &apos;s been proven to me time and time again as people have walked up to me this week simply because of what i &apos;m wearing and we &apos;ve had great conversations
ted_01161_0275520_0279410 so obviously this is not all going to fit back in my tiny suitcase
ted_01161_0279530_0283540 so before i go home to brooklyn i &apos;m going to donate everything back
ted_01161_0283700_0288500 because the lesson i &apos;m trying to learn myself this week is that it &apos;s okay to let go
ted_01161_0289030_0303370 i don &apos;t need to get emotionally attached to these things because around the corner there is always going to be another crazy colorful shiny outfit just waiting for me if i put a little love in my heart and look
ted_01161_0304250_0305110 thank you very much
ted_01161_0308995_0309195 applause
ted_01161_0309050_0309250 thank you
ted_01165_0012370_0017990 in 2007 i decided that we needed to reconceptualize how we thought about economic development
ted_01165_0018550_0031980 our new goal should be that when every family thinks about where they want to live and work they should be able to choose between at least a handful of different cities that were all competing to attract new residents
ted_01165_0033060_0035600 now we &apos;re a long way away from that goal right now
ted_01165_0035640_0041240 there are billions of people in developing countries who don &apos;t have even a single city that would be willing to welcome them
ted_01165_0041800_0047220 but the amazing thing about cities is they &apos;re worth so much more than it costs to build them
ted_01165_0047900_0053050 so we could easily supply the world with dozens maybe hundreds of new cities
ted_01165_0054010_0057980 now this might sound preposterous to you if you &apos;ve never thought about new cities
ted_01165_0057980_0060210 but just substitute apartment building for cities
ted_01165_0060700_0065080 imagine half the people who wanted to be in apartments already had them the other half aren &apos;t there yet
ted_01165_0065590_0071240 you could try and expand the capacity by doing additions on all the existing apartments
ted_01165_0071620_0080020 but you know what you &apos;d run into is those apartments and the surrounding areas have rules to avoid discomfort and the distractions of construction
ted_01165_0080210_0082600 so it &apos;s extremely hard to do all of those additions
ted_01165_0082780_0092420 but you could go out someplace brand new build a brand new apartment building as long as the rules there were ones that facilitated construction rather than getting in the way
ted_01165_0093280_0102410 so i proposed that governments create new reform zones big enough to hold cities and gave them a name charter cities
ted_01165_0103330_0110590 later i learned that at about this same time javier and octavio were thinking about the challenge of reform in honduras
ted_01165_0111640_0123050 they knew that about 75000 hondurans every year would leave to go to the united states and they wanted to ask what could they do to make sure that those people could stay and do the same things in honduras
ted_01165_0123060_0144360 at one point javier said to octavio what if we took some of our empty land what if we just gave it to an embassy give some to the us embassy give some to the canadian embassy and then if people want to go work under the rules of canada or under the rules of the united states they can go get jobs do everything they do on those embassy grounds that they would otherwise have to go to canada or the us to do
ted_01165_0146490_0151110 in the summer of 2009 honduras went through a wrenching constitutional crisis
ted_01165_0151630_0161930 at the next regularly scheduled election pepe lobo won in a landslide on a platform that promised reform but reconciliation as well
ted_01165_0162730_0165190 he asked octavio to be his chief of staff
ted_01165_0166290_0169880 meanwhile i was getting ready to give a talk at tedglobal
ted_01165_0170420_0180270 through a process of refinement trial and error a lot of user testing i tried to boil this complicated concept of charter city down to the bare essentials
ted_01165_0182230_0188850 the first point was the importance of rules like those rules that say you can &apos;t come in and disturb all the existing apartment holders
ted_01165_0189340_0196780 we pay a lot of attention to new technologies but it takes technologies and rules to get progress and it &apos;s usually the rules that hold us back
ted_01165_0198350_0203490 in the fall of 2010 a friend from guatemala sent octavio a link to the tedtalk
ted_01165_0204590_0215750 he showed it to javier they called me they said let &apos;s present this to the leaders of our country so in december we met in miami in a hotel conference room
ted_01165_0216630_0222390 i tried to explain this point about how valuable cities are how much more valuable they are than they cost
ted_01165_0222620_0232460 and i used this slide showing how valuable the raw land is in a place like new york city notice land that &apos;s worth thousands of dollars in some cases per square meter
ted_01165_0233740_0244130 but it was a fairly abstract discussion and at some point when there was a pause octavio said paul maybe we could watch the tedtalk
ted_01165_0244385_0244585 laughing
ted_01165_0246950_0262010 so the tedtalk laid out in very simple terms a charter city is a place where you start with uninhabited land a charter that specifies the rules that will apply there and then a chance for people to opt in to go live under those rules or not
ted_01165_0263620_0272870 so i was asked by the president of honduras who said that we need to do this project this is important this could be the way forward for our country
ted_01165_0273420_0277270 i was asked to come to tegucigalpa and talk again on january fourth and fifth
ted_01165_0278380_0288780 so i presented another factfilled lecture that included a slide like this which tried to make the point that if you want to create a lot of value in a city it has to be very big
ted_01165_0289170_0293460 this is a picture of denver and the outline is the new airport that was built in denver
ted_01165_0293680_0297730 this airport alone covers more than 100 square kilometers
ted_01165_0298070_0304010 so i was trying to persuade the hondurans if you build a new city you &apos;ve got to start with a site that &apos;s at least 1000 square kilometers
ted_01165_0304010_0316000 that &apos;s more than 250 hundredthousand acres everybody applauded politely the faces in the audience were very serious and attentive
ted_01165_0317280_0325320 the leader of the congress came up on stage and said professor romer thank you very much for your lecture but maybe we could watch the tedtalk
ted_01165_0326870_0332880 i &apos;ve got it here on my laptop so i sat down and they played the tedtalk
ted_01165_0333490_0338240 and it got to the essence which is that a new city could offer new choices for people
ted_01165_0338520_0344010 there would be a choice of a city which you could go to which could be in honduras instead of hundreds of miles away in the north
ted_01165_0344700_0346690 and it also involved new choices for leaders
ted_01165_0346730_0361180 because the leaders in the government there in honduras would need help from partner countries who could benefit from partner countries who help them set up the rules in this charter and the enforcement so everybody can trust that the charter really will be enforced
ted_01165_0361550_0378280 and the insight of president lobo was that that assurance of enforcement that i was thinking about as a way to get the foreign investors to come in and build the city could be equally important for all the different parties in honduras who had suffered for so many years from fear and distrust
ted_01165_0379110_0380420 we went and looked at a site
ted_01165_0380540_0381450 this picture &apos;s from there
ted_01165_0381450_0384500 it easily could hold a thousand square kilometers
ted_01165_0385170_0394690 and shortly thereafter on january 19th they voted in the congress to amend their constitution to have a constitutional provision that allows for special development regions
ted_01165_0395300_0403110 in a country which had just gone through this wrenching crisis the vote in the congress in favor of this constitutional amendment was 124 to one
ted_01165_0404440_0407360 all parties all factions in society backed this
ted_01165_0407910_0410690 to be part of the constitution you actually have to pass it twice in the congress
ted_01165_0410690_0415130 on february 17th they passed it again with another vote of 114 to one
ted_01165_0416330_0427600 immediately after that vote on february 21st to the 24th a delegation of about 30 hondurans went to the two places in the world that are most interested in getting into the city building business
ted_01165_0428290_0429490 one is south korea
ted_01165_0429780_0435100 this is a picture of a big new city center that &apos;s being built in south korea bigger than downtown boston
ted_01165_0435390_0439910 everything you see there was built in four years after they spent four years getting the permits
ted_01165_0441190_0443860 the other place that &apos;s very interested in city building is singapore
ted_01165_0443890_0447210 they &apos;ve actually built two cities already in china and are preparing the third
ted_01165_0448090_0451130 so if you think about this practically here &apos;s where we are
ted_01165_0451650_0454530 they &apos;ve got a site they &apos;re already thinking about this site for the second city
ted_01165_0455010_0460740 they &apos;re putting in place a legal system that could allow for managers to come in and also an external legal system
ted_01165_0460740_0469860 one country has already volunteered to let its supreme court be the court of final appeal for the new judicial system there there &apos;s designers and builders of cities who are very interested
ted_01165_0470180_0472240 they even can bring with them some financing
ted_01165_0472580_0476100 but the one thing you know they &apos;ve already solved is that there &apos;s lots of tenants
ted_01165_0476450_0484100 there &apos;s lots of businesses that would like to locate in the americas especially in a place with a free trade zone and there &apos;s lots of people who &apos;d like to go there
ted_01165_0484500_0489560 around the world there &apos;s 700 million people who say they &apos;d like to move permanently someplace else right now
ted_01165_0489860_0493290 there &apos;s a million a year who leave latin america to go to the united states
ted_01165_0493750_0502270 many of these are a father who has to leave his family behind to go get a job sometimes a single mother who has to get enough money to even pay for food or clothing
ted_01165_0502540_0509520 sadly sometimes there are even children who are trying to get reunited with their parents that they haven &apos;t seen in some cases for a decade
ted_01165_0511390_0515620 so what kind of an idea is it to think about building a brand new city in honduras
ted_01165_0515870_0519580 or to build a dozen of these or a hundred of these around the world
ted_01165_0519630_0528790 what kind of an idea is it to think about insisting that every family have a choice of several cities that are competing to attract new residents
ted_01165_0530310_0531750 this is an idea worth spreading
ted_01165_0532710_0536070 and my friends from honduras asked me to say thank you ted
ted_01165_0541835_0542035 applause
ted_01166_0012650_0022520 i want you to imagine two couples in the middle of 1979 on the exact same day at the exact same moment each conceiving a baby ok
ted_01166_0022980_0024970 so two couples each conceiving one baby
ted_01166_0024970_0032810 now i don &apos;t want you to spend too much time imagining the conception because if you do you &apos;re not going to listen to me so just imagine that for a moment
ted_01166_0032850_0041150 and in this scenario i want to imagine that in one case the sperm is carrying a y chromosome meeting that x chromosome of the egg
ted_01166_0041640_0046180 and in the other case the sperm is carrying an x chromosome meeting the x chromosome of the egg
ted_01166_0047120_0049210 both are viable both take off
ted_01166_0049840_0051100 we &apos;ll come back to these people later
ted_01166_0051690_0055150 so i wear two hats in most of what i do
ted_01166_0055900_0058890 as the one hat i do history of anatomy
ted_01166_0059130_0073660 i &apos;m a historian by training and what i study in that case is the way that people have dealt with anatomy meaning human bodies animal bodies how they dealt with bodily fluids concepts of bodies how have they thought about bodies
ted_01166_0073750_0083830 the other hat that i &apos;ve worn in my work is as an activist as a patient advocate or as i sometimes say as an impatient advocate for people who are patients of doctors
ted_01166_0084240_0089440 in that case what i &apos;ve worked with is people who have body types that challenge social norms
ted_01166_0089880_0095450 so some of what i &apos;ve worked on for example is people who are conjoined twins two people within one body
ted_01166_0096160_0100650 some of what i &apos;ve worked on is people who have dwarfism so people who are much shorter than typical
ted_01166_0101310_0109020 and a lot of what i &apos;ve worked on is people who have atypical sex so people who don &apos;t have the standard male or the standard female body types
ted_01166_0109400_0112570 and as a general term we can use the term intersex for this
ted_01166_0113040_0115460 intersex comes in a lot of different forms
ted_01166_0115530_0120770 i &apos;ll just give you a few examples of the types of ways you can have sex that isn &apos;t standard for male or female
ted_01166_0121350_0133290 so in one instance you can have somebody who has an xy chromosomal basis and that sry gene on the y chromosome tells the protogonads which we all have in the fetal life to become testes
ted_01166_0133540_0136460 so in the fetal life those testes are pumping out testosterone
ted_01166_0136760_0143850 but because this individual lacks receptors to hear that testosterone the body doesn &apos;t react to the testosterone
ted_01166_0143850_0146800 and this is a syndrome called androgen insensitivity syndrome
ted_01166_0147610_0150630 so lots of levels of testosterone but no reaction to it
ted_01166_0150640_0154000 as a consequence the body develops more along the female typical path
ted_01166_0154470_0156380 when the child is born she looks like a girl
ted_01166_0156810_0159890 she is a girl she is raised as a girl
ted_01166_0159890_0167740 and it &apos;s often not until she hits puberty and she &apos;s growing and developing breasts but she &apos;s not getting her period that somebody figures out something &apos;s up here
ted_01166_0168080_0174470 and they do some tests and figure out that instead of having ovaries inside and a uterus she has testes inside and she has a y chromosome
ted_01166_0175060_0179810 now what &apos;s important to understand is you may think of this person as really being male but they &apos;re really not
ted_01166_0180540_0185050 females like males have in our bodies something called the adrenal glands
ted_01166_0185050_0186240 they &apos;re in the back of our body
ted_01166_0186470_0189700 and the adrenal glands make androgens which are a masculinizing hormone
ted_01166_0190050_0199430 most females like me i believe myself to be a typical female i don &apos;t actually know my chromosomal makeup but i think i &apos;m probably typical most females like me are actually androgensensitive
ted_01166_0199440_0201970 we &apos;re making androgen and we &apos;re responding to androgens
ted_01166_0202470_0210520 the consequence is that somebody like me has actually had a brain exposed to more androgens than the woman born with testes who has androgen insensitivity syndrome
ted_01166_0211150_0217660 so sex is really complicated it &apos;s not just that intersex people are in the middle of all the sex spectrum in some ways they can be all over the place
ted_01166_0217980_0231670 another example a few years ago i got a call from a man who was 19 years old who was born a boy raised a boy had a girlfriend had sex with his girlfriend had a life as a guy and had just found out that he had ovaries and a uterus inside
ted_01166_0232470_0236480 what he had was an extreme form of a condition called congenital adrenal hyperplasia
ted_01166_0236660_0246080 he had xx chromosomes and in the womb his adrenal glands were in such high gear that it created essentially a masculine hormonal environment
ted_01166_0246340_0251980 and as a consequence his genitals were masculinized his brain was subject to the more typical masculine component of hormones
ted_01166_0252440_0255450 and he was born looking like a boy nobody suspected anything
ted_01166_0255720_0265270 and it was only when he had reached the age of 19 that he began to have enough medical problems from menstruating internally that doctors figured out that in fact he was female internally
ted_01166_0265930_0276600 ok so just one more quick example of a way you can have intersex some people who have xx chromosomes develop what are called ovotestis which is when you have ovarian tissue with testicular tissue wrapped around it
ted_01166_0277040_0278850 and we &apos;re not exactly sure why that happens
ted_01166_0279090_0281590 so sex can come in lots of different varieties
ted_01166_0282160_0297230 the reason that children with these kinds of bodies whether it &apos;s dwarfism or it &apos;s conjoined twinning or it &apos;s an intersex type are often normalized by surgeons is not because it actually leaves them better off in terms of physical health
ted_01166_0297620_0300030 in many cases people are actually perfectly healthy
ted_01166_0300620_0306250 the reason they &apos;re often subject to various kinds of surgeries is because they threaten our social categories
ted_01166_0306550_0312370 our system has been based typically on the idea that a particular kind of anatomy comes with a particular identity
ted_01166_0312590_0322510 so we have the concept that what it means to be a woman is to have a female identity what it means to be a black person is allegedly to have an african anatomy in terms of your history
ted_01166_0323140_0326620 and so we have this terribly simplistic idea
ted_01166_0326930_0333230 and when we &apos;re faced with a body that actually presents us something quite different it startles us in terms of those categorizations
ted_01166_0334370_0338250 so we have a lot of very romantic ideas in our culture about individualism
ted_01166_0338300_0341260 and our nation &apos;s really founded on a very romantic concept of individualism
ted_01166_0341880_0347230 you can imagine how startling then it is when you have children who are born who are two people inside of one body
ted_01166_0348690_0358350 where i ran into the most heat from this most recently was last year when south african runner caster semenya had her sex called into question at the international games in berlin
ted_01166_0358760_0370010 i had a lot of journalists calling me asking me which is the test they &apos;re going to run that will tell us whether or not caster semenya is male or female and i had to explain to the journalists there isn &apos;t such a test
ted_01166_0370320_0384490 in fact we now know that sex is complicated enough that we have to admit nature doesn &apos;t draw the line for us between male and female or between male and intersex and female and intersex we actually draw that line on nature
ted_01166_0385010_0400900 so what we have is a sort of situation where the farther our science goes the more we have to admit to ourselves that these categories that we thought of as stable anatomical categories that mapped very simply to stable identity categories are a lot more fuzzy than we thought
ted_01166_0401390_0403220 and it &apos;s not just in terms of sex
ted_01166_0403330_0408960 it &apos;s also in terms of race which turns out to be vastly more complicated than our terminology has allowed
ted_01166_0409530_0412680 as we look we get into all sorts of uncomfortable areas
ted_01166_0412680_0418490 we look for example about the fact that we share at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees
ted_01166_0418810_0423020 what are we to make of the fact that we differ from them only really by a few nucleotides
ted_01166_0424080_0433840 and as we get farther and farther with our science we get more and more into a discomforted zone where we have to acknowledge that the simplistic categories we &apos;ve had are probably overly simplistic
ted_01166_0434650_0438280 so we &apos;re seeing this in all sorts of places in human life
ted_01166_0438280_0445060 one of the places we &apos;re seeing it for example in our culture in the united states today is battles over the beginning of life and the end of life
ted_01166_0445320_0452530 we have difficult conversations about at what point we decide a body becomes a human such that it has a different right than a fetal life
ted_01166_0453140_0460420 we have very difficult conversations nowadays probably not out in the open as much as within medicine about the question of when somebody &apos;s dead
ted_01166_0460700_0464770 in the past our ancestors never had to struggle so much with this question of when somebody was dead
ted_01166_0465160_0468730 at most they &apos;d stick a feather on somebody &apos;s nose and if it twitched they didn &apos;t bury them yet
ted_01166_0468950_0471260 if it stopped twitching you bury them
ted_01166_0471430_0477110 but today we have a situation where we want to take vital organs out of beings and give them to other beings
ted_01166_0477400_0487780 and as a consequence we have to struggle with this really difficult question about who &apos;s dead and this leads us to a really difficult situation where we don &apos;t have such simple categories as we &apos;ve had before
ted_01166_0488190_0493470 now you might think that all this breakingdown of categories would make somebody like me really happy
ted_01166_0493670_0498510 i &apos;m a political progressive i defend people with unusual bodies but i have to admit to you that it makes me nervous
ted_01166_0498900_0503860 understanding that these categories are really much more unstable than we thought makes me tense
ted_01166_0504060_0506800 it makes me tense from the point of view of thinking about democracy
ted_01166_0507220_0512380 so in order to tell you about that tension i have to first admit to you a huge fan of the founding fathers
ted_01166_0512680_0516030 i know they were racists i know they were sexist but they were great
ted_01166_0516300_0528120 i mean they were so brave and so bold and so radical in what they did that i find myself watching that cheesy musical 1776 every few years and it &apos;s not because of the music which is totally forgettable
ted_01166_0528430_0531890 it &apos;s because of what happened in 1776 with the founding fathers
ted_01166_0532470_0537750 the founding fathers were for my point of view the original anatomical activists and this is why
ted_01166_0538480_0546190 what they rejected was an anatomical concept and replaced it with another one that was radical and beautiful and held us for 200 years
ted_01166_0546670_0555480 so as you all recall what our founding fathers were rejecting was a concept of monarchy and the monarchy was basically based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy
ted_01166_0555560_0561040 the monarchs of the old world didn &apos;t have a concept of dna but they did have a concept of birthright
ted_01166_0561330_0562810 they had a concept of blue blood
ted_01166_0563060_0573230 they had the idea that the people who would be in political power should be in political power because of the blood being passed down from grandfather to father to son and so forth
ted_01166_0573910_0592760 the founding fathers rejected that idea and they replaced it with a new anatomical concept and that concept was all men are created equal they leveled that playing field and decided the anatomy that mattered was the commonality of anatomy not the difference in anatomy and that was a really radical thing to do
ted_01166_0593540_0598600 now they were doing it in part because they were part of an enlightenment system where two things were growing up together
ted_01166_0599060_0604310 and that was democracy growing up but it was also science growing up at the same time
ted_01166_0604960_0611730 and it &apos;s really clear if you look at the history of the founding fathers a lot of them were very interested in science and they were interested in the concept of a naturalistic world
ted_01166_0612010_0623110 they were moving away from supernatural explanations and they were rejecting things like a supernatural concept of power where it transmitted because of a very vague concept of birthright
ted_01166_0623460_0625590 they were moving towards a naturalistic concept
ted_01166_0625770_0631390 and if you look for example in the declaration of independence they talk about nature and nature &apos;s god
ted_01166_0631600_0633650 they don &apos;t talk about god and god &apos;s nature
ted_01166_0633660_0637130 they &apos;re talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are
ted_01166_0637620_0643540 so as part of that they were coming to us with a concept that was about anatomical commonality
ted_01166_0643760_0648300 and in doing so they were really setting up in a beautiful way the civil rights movement of the future
ted_01166_0648510_0651400 they didn &apos;t think of it that way but they did it for us and it was great
ted_01166_0651630_0653810 so what happened years afterwards
ted_01166_0653810_0676300 what happened was women for example who wanted the right to vote took the founding fathers &apos; concept of anatomical commonality being more important than anatomical difference and said the fact that we have a uterus and ovaries is not significant enough in terms of a difference to mean that we shouldn &apos;t have the right to vote the right to full citizenship the right to own property etc and women successfully argued that
ted_01166_0676570_0695720 next came the successful civil rights movement where we found people like sojourner truth talking about ain &apos;t i a woman we find men on the marching lines of the civil rights movement saying i am a man again people of color appealing to a commonality of anatomy over a difference of anatomy again successfully
ted_01166_0695890_0698210 we see the same thing with the disability rights movement
ted_01166_0699280_0706960 the problem is of course that as we begin to look at all that commonality we have to begin to question why we maintain certain divisions
ted_01166_0707660_0711540 mind you i want to maintain some divisions anatomically in our culture
ted_01166_0711730_0714970 for example i don &apos;t want to give a fish the same rights as a human
ted_01166_0715480_0717840 i don &apos;t want to say we give up entirely on anatomy
ted_01166_0717980_0721920 i don &apos;t want to say a fiveyearold should be allowed to consent to sex or consent to marry
ted_01166_0722340_0727510 so there are some anatomical divisions that make sense to me and that i think we should retain
ted_01166_0727730_0733170 but the challenge is trying to figure out which ones they are and why do we retain them and do they have meaning
ted_01166_0733340_0736640 so let &apos;s go back to those two beings conceived at the beginning of this talk
ted_01166_0737090_0742270 we have two beings both conceived in the middle of 1979 on the exact same day
ted_01166_0742500_0752870 let &apos;s imagine one of them mary is born three months prematurely so she &apos;s born on june 1 1980 henry by contrast is born at term so he &apos;s born on march 1 1980
ted_01166_0753590_0766000 simply by virtue of the fact that mary was born prematurely three months she comes into all sorts of rights three months earlier than henry does the right to consent to sex the right to vote the right to drink
ted_01166_0766380_0772950 henry has to wait for all of that not because he &apos;s actually any different in age biologically except in terms of when he was born
ted_01166_0773990_0776730 we find other kinds of weirdness in terms of what their rights are
ted_01166_0776890_0787560 henry by virtue of being assumed to be male although i haven &apos;t told you that he &apos;s the xy one by virtue of being assumed to be male is now liable to be drafted which mary does not need to worry about
ted_01166_0787970_0794350 mary meanwhile cannot in all the states have the same right that henry has in all the states namely the right to marry
ted_01166_0794670_0800620 henry can marry in every state a woman but mary can only marry today in a few states a woman
ted_01166_0801300_0807680 so we have these anatomical categories that persist that are in many ways problematic and questionable
ted_01166_0807860_0822430 and the question to me becomes what do we do as our science gets to be so good in looking at anatomy that we reach the point where we have to admit that a democracy that &apos;s been based on anatomy might start falling apart
ted_01166_0823870_0841560 i don &apos;t want to give up the science but at the same time it feels sometimes like the science is coming out from under us so where do we go it seems like what happens in our culture is a sort of pragmatic attitude we have to draw the line somewhere so we will draw the line somewhere but a lot of people get stuck in a very strange position
ted_01166_0841680_0851880 so for example texas has at one point decided that what it means to marry a man is to mean that you don &apos;t have a y chromosome and what it means to marry a woman means you have a y chromosome
ted_01166_0852480_0854510 in practice they don &apos;t test people for their chromosomes
ted_01166_0854710_0859460 but this is also very bizarre because of the story i told you at the beginning about androgen insensitivity syndrome
ted_01166_0860880_0868650 if we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy dr martin luther king he offers us something of a solution in his i have a dream speech
ted_01166_0868650_0875480 he says we should judge people based not on the color of their skin but on the content of their character moving beyond anatomy
ted_01166_0875650_0879670 and i want to say yeah that sounds like a really good idea but in practice how do you do it
ted_01166_0880320_0883200 how do you judge people based on the content of character
ted_01166_0883800_0894900 i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that is how we should distribute rights in terms of humans because i have to admit that there are some golden retrievers i know that are probably more deserving of social services than some humans i know
ted_01166_0895460_0904470 i also want to say there are probably also some yellow labradors that i know that are more capable of informed intelligent mature decisions about sexual relations than some 40yearolds that i know
ted_01166_0904780_0909290 so how do we operationalize the question of content of character
ted_01166_0909290_0910880 it turns out to be really difficult
ted_01166_0911140_0920530 and part of me also wonders what if content of character turns out to be something that &apos;s scannable in the future able to be seen with an fmri
ted_01166_0921030_0922490 do we really want to go there
ted_01166_0923090_0924310 i &apos;m not sure where we go
ted_01166_0924450_0931840 what i do know is that it seems to be really important to think about the idea of the united states being in the lead of thinking about this issue of democracy
ted_01166_0931840_0936570 we &apos;ve done a really good job struggling with democracy and i think we would do a good job in the future
ted_01166_0936750_0947010 we don &apos;t have a situation that iran has for example where a man who &apos;s sexually attracted to other men is liable to be murdered unless he &apos;s willing to submit to a sex change in which case he &apos;s allowed to live
ted_01166_0947890_0949580 we don &apos;t have that kind of situation
ted_01166_0949580_0959710 i &apos;m glad to say we don &apos;t have the kind of situation with a surgeon i talked to a few years ago who had brought over a set of conjoined twins in order to separate them partly to make a name for himself
ted_01166_0960040_0970190 but when i was on the phone with him asking why he &apos;ll do this surgery this was a very highrisk surgery his answer was that in this other nation these children were going to be treated very badly and so he had to do this
ted_01166_0970530_0984130 my response to him was well have you considered political asylum instead of a separation surgery the united states has offered tremendous possibility for allowing people to be the way they are without having them have to be changed for the sake of the state
ted_01166_0984800_0986380 so i think we have to be in the lead
ted_01166_0986850_0991630 well just to close i want to suggest to you that i &apos;ve been talking a lot about the fathers
ted_01166_0991930_0998310 and i want to think about the possibilities of what democracy might look like or might have looked like if we had more involved the mothers
ted_01166_0999370_1010220 and i want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist and that is that i think that there may be different kinds of insights that can come from different kinds of anatomies particularly when we have people thinking in groups
ted_01166_1011560_1015570 for years because i &apos;ve been interested in intersex i &apos;ve also been interested in sexdifference research
ted_01166_1015840_1022650 and one of the things that i &apos;ve been interested in is looking at the differences between males and females in terms of the way they think and operate in the world
ted_01166_1023210_1038740 and what we know from crosscultural studies is that females on average not everyone but on average are more inclined to be very attentive to complex social relations and to taking care of people who are basically vulnerable within the group
ted_01166_1039550_1043130 and so if we think about that we have an interesting situation in hands
ted_01166_1043490_1052130 years ago when i was in graduate school one of my graduate advisors who knew i was interested in feminism i considered myself a feminist as i still do asked a really strange question
ted_01166_1052130_1057830 he said tell me what &apos;s feminine about feminism and i thought well that &apos;s the dumbest question i &apos;ve ever heard
ted_01166_1057830_1067820 feminism is all about undoing stereotypes about gender so there &apos;s nothing feminine about feminism but the more i thought about his question the more i thought there might be something feminine about feminism
ted_01166_1068120_1082130 that is to say there might be something on average different about female brains from male brains that makes us more attentive to deeply complex social relationships and more attentive to taking care of the vulnerable
ted_01166_1082150_1098300 so whereas the fathers were extremely attentive to figuring out how to protect individuals from the state it &apos;s possible that if we injected more mothers into this concept what we would have is more of a concept of not just how to protect but how to care for each other
ted_01166_1098690_1109100 and maybe that &apos;s where we need to go in the future when we take democracy beyond anatomy is to think less about the individual body in terms of the identity and think more about those relationships
ted_01166_1109350_1115340 so that as we the people try to create a more perfect union we &apos;re thinking about what we do for each other
ted_01166_1115830_1116280 thank you
ted_01166_1118195_1118395 applause
ted_01171_0012830_0015540 as an artist connection is very important to me
ted_01171_0016560_0024230 through my work i &apos;m trying to articulate that humans are not separate from nature and that everything is interconnected
ted_01171_0026190_0029840 i first went to antarctica almost 10 years ago where i saw my first icebergs
ted_01171_0031310_0032230 i was in awe
ted_01171_0033290_0039780 my heart beat fast my head was dizzy trying to comprehend what it was that stood in front of me
ted_01171_0039950_0051210 the icebergs around me were almost 200 feet out of the water and i could only help but wonder that this was one snowflake on top of another snowflake year after year
ted_01171_0052840_0059360 icebergs are born when they calve off of glaciers or break off of ice shelves
ted_01171_0062650_0065750 each iceberg has its own individual personality
ted_01171_0066930_0072330 they have a distinct way of interacting with their environment and their experiences
ted_01171_0073160_0082230 some refuse to give up and hold on to the bitter end while others can &apos;t take it anymore and crumble in a fit of dramatic passion
ted_01171_0084020_0092600 it &apos;s easy to think when you look at an iceberg that they &apos;re isolated that they &apos;re separate and alone much like we as humans sometimes view ourselves
ted_01171_0093050_0094620 but the reality is far from it
ted_01171_0095690_0100600 as an iceberg melts i am breathing in its ancient atmosphere
ted_01171_0101810_0110040 as the iceberg melts it is releasing mineralrich fresh water that nourishes many forms of life
ted_01171_0112060_0123900 i approach photographing these icebergs as if i &apos;m making portraits of my ancestors knowing that in these individual moments they exist in that way and will never exist that way again
ted_01171_0124640_0132780 it is not a death when they melt it is not an end but a continuation of their path through the cycle of life
ted_01171_0138450_0144240 some of the ice in the icebergs that i photograph is very young a couple thousand years old
ted_01171_0144600_0147700 and some of the ice is over 100000 years old
ted_01171_0147700_0164100 the last pictures i &apos;d like to show you are of an iceberg that i photographed in qeqetarsuaq greenland
ted_01171_0165350_0176270 it &apos;s a very rare occasion that you get to actually witness an iceberg rolling so here it is you can see on the left side a small boat
ted_01171_0176600_0178290 that &apos;s about a 15foot boat
ted_01171_0179060_0185020 and i &apos;d like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and where it is at the waterline
ted_01171_0186240_0190720 you can see here it begins to roll and the boat has moved to the other side and the man is standing there
ted_01171_0190950_0193410 this is an averagesize greenlandic iceberg
ted_01171_0193430_0198180 it &apos;s about 120 feet above the water or 40 meters
ted_01171_0198310_0200210 and this video is real time
ted_01171_0207965_0208165 music
ted_01171_0229990_0233800 and just like that the iceberg shows you a different side of its personality
ted_01171_0236070_0236500 thank you
ted_01176_0012990_0019700 you know what i do is write for children and i &apos;m probably america &apos;s most widely read children &apos;s author in fact
ted_01176_0019700_0024360 and i always tell people that i don &apos;t want to show up looking like a scientist
ted_01176_0024560_0030320 you can have me as a farmer or in leathers and no one has ever chose farmer
ted_01176_0031510_0034490 i &apos;m here today to talk to you about circles and epiphanies
ted_01176_0035690_0039340 and you know an epiphany is usually something you find that you dropped someplace
ted_01176_0039340_0042940 you &apos;ve just got to go around the block to see it as an epiphany
ted_01176_0044040_0045480 that &apos;s a painting of a circle
ted_01176_0045490_0048100 a friend of mine did that richard bollingbroke
ted_01176_0048420_0051960 it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle that i &apos;m going to tell you about
ted_01176_0052560_0059520 my circle began back in the &apos; 60s in high school in stow ohio where i was the class queer
ted_01176_0059940_0067050 i was the guy beaten up bloody every week in the boys &apos; room until one teacher saved my life
ted_01176_0067350_0073040 she saved my life by letting me go to the bathroom in the teachers &apos; lounge
ted_01176_0073440_0079040 she did it in secret she did it for three years and i had to get out of town
ted_01176_0079530_0094070 i had a thumb i had 85 dollars and i ended up in san francisco california met a lover and back in the &apos; 80s found it necessary to begin work on aids organizations
ted_01176_0095220_0104500 about three or four years ago i got a phone call in the middle of the night from that teacher mrs posten who said i need to see you
ted_01176_0104800_0109130 i &apos;m disappointed that we never got to know each other as adults
ted_01176_0109160_0115870 could you please come to ohio and please bring that man that i know you have found by now
ted_01176_0117390_0126190 and i should mention that i have pancreatic cancer and i &apos;d like you to please be quick about this
ted_01176_0127040_0129260 well the next day we were in cleveland
ted_01176_0130030_0135780 we took a look at her we laughed we cried and we knew that she needed to be in a hospice
ted_01176_0136190_0143800 we found her one we got her there and we took care of her and watched over her family because it was necessary
ted_01176_0143810_0145890 it &apos;s something we knew how to do
ted_01176_0146570_0156730 and just as the woman who wanted to know me as an adult got to know me she turned into a box of ashes and was placed in my hands
ted_01176_0157480_0167960 and what had happened was the circle had closed it had become a circle and that epiphany i talked about presented itself
ted_01176_0168450_0171950 the epiphany is that death is a part of life
ted_01176_0172240_0177540 she saved my life i and my partner saved hers
ted_01176_0179160_0182950 and you know that part of life needs everything that the rest of life does
ted_01176_0182950_0187800 it needs truth and beauty and i &apos;m so happy it &apos;s been mentioned so much here today
ted_01176_0188340_0198640 it also needs it needs dignity love and pleasure and it &apos;s our job to hand those things out
ted_01176_0199450_0205120 thank you
ted_01176_0205045_0205245 applause
ted_01328_0017110_0029540 in the 1980s in communist eastern germany if you owned a typewriter you had to register it with the government
ted_01328_0029930_0035150 you had to register a sample sheet of text out of the typewriter
ted_01328_0035520_0040550 and this was done so the government could track where the text was coming from
ted_01328_0040680_0049540 if they found a paper which had the wrong kind of thought they could track down who created that thought
ted_01328_0050960_0059660 and we in the west couldn &apos;t understand how anybody would do this how much this would restrict freedom of speech
ted_01328_0059730_0062740 we would never do that in our own countries
ted_01328_0064980_0088900 but today in 2011 if you go and buy a color laser printer from any major laser printer manufacturer and print a page that page will end up having slight yellow dots printed on every single page in a pattern which makes the page unique to you and to your printer
ted_01328_0091000_0094030 this is happening to us today
ted_01328_0096100_0099050 and nobody seems to be making a fuss about it
ted_01328_0100270_0111620 and this is an example of the ways our own governments are using technology against us the citizens
ted_01328_0113810_0117830 and this is one of the main three sources of online problems today
ted_01328_0118140_0124100 if we look at what &apos;s really happening in the online world we can group the attacks based on the attackers
ted_01328_0124700_0125810 we have three main groups
ted_01328_0126460_0127750 we have online criminals
ted_01328_0127790_0132110 like here we have mr dmitry golubov from the city of kiev in ukraine
ted_01328_0133070_0137450 and the motives of online criminals are very easy to understand
ted_01328_0137460_0138800 these guys make money
ted_01328_0139110_0144920 they use online attacks to make lots of money and lots and lots of it
ted_01328_0145360_0155560 we actually have several cases of millionaires online multimillionaires who made money with their attacks here &apos;s vladimir tsastsin from tartu in estonia
ted_01328_0156010_0165830 this is bjorn sundin this is matthew anderson tariq aldaour and so on and so on
ted_01328_0166850_0186770 these guys make their fortunes online but they make it through the illegal means of using things like banking trojans to steal money from our bank accounts while we do online banking or with keyloggers to collect our credit card information while we are doing online shopping from an infected computer
ted_01328_0187860_0200500 the us secret service two months ago froze the swiss bank account of mr sam jain right here and that bank account had 149 million us dollars in it when it was frozen
ted_01328_0200870_0203800 mr jain himself is on the loose nobody knows where he is
ted_01328_0205300_0216990 and i claim it &apos;s already today that it &apos;s more likely for any of us to become the victim of a crime online than here in the real world
ted_01328_0218360_0221020 and it &apos;s very obvious that this is only going to get worse
ted_01328_0221050_0225310 in the future the majority of crime will be happening online
ted_01328_0228140_0233570 the second major group of attackers that we are watching today are not motivated by money
ted_01328_0233790_0241820 they &apos;re motivated by something else motivated by protests motivated by an opinion motivated by the laughs
ted_01328_0242320_0251500 groups like anonymous have risen up over the last 12 months and have become a major player in the field of online attacks
ted_01328_0252960_0266670 so those are the three main attackers criminals who do it for the money hacktivists like anonymous doing it for the protest but then the last group are nation states governments doing the attacks
ted_01328_0269250_0272630 and then we look at cases like what happened in diginotar
ted_01328_0272730_0277990 this is a prime example of what happens when governments attack against their own citizens
ted_01328_0279040_0285570 diginotar is a certificate authority from the netherlands or actually it was
ted_01328_0285620_0292300 it was running into bankruptcy last fall because they were hacked into
ted_01328_0292610_0295740 somebody broke in and they hacked it thoroughly
ted_01328_0297230_0315760 and i asked last week in a meeting with dutch government representatives i asked one of the leaders of the team whether he found plausible that people died because of the diginotar hack
ted_01328_0318130_0320440 and his answer was yes
ted_01328_0322650_0326470 so how do people die as the result of a hack like this
ted_01328_0327720_0332880 well diginotar is a ca they sell certificates what do you do with certificates
ted_01328_0333080_0343170 well you need a certificate if you have a website that has https ssl encrypted services services like gmail
ted_01328_0344010_0367900 now we all or a big part of us use gmail or one of their competitors but these services are especially popular in totalitarian states like iran where dissidents use foreign services like gmail because they know they are more trustworthy than the local services and they are encrypted over ssl connections so the local government can &apos;t snoop on their discussions
ted_01328_0368850_0373690 except they can if they hack into a foreign ca and issue rogue certificates
ted_01328_0374030_0377670 and this is exactly what happened with the case of diginotar
ted_01328_0377670_0385950 what about arab spring and things that have been happening for example in egypt
ted_01328_0387160_0397440 well in egypt the rioters looted the headquarters of the egyptian secret police in april 2011 and when they were looting the building they found lots of papers
ted_01328_0397650_0417700 among those papers was this binder entitled finfisher and within that binder were notes from a company based in germany which had sold to the egyptian government a set of tools for intercepting at a very large scale all the communication of the citizens of the country
ted_01328_0418030_0422040 they had sold this tool for 280000 euros to the egyptian government
ted_01328_0422050_0424990 the company headquarters are right here
ted_01328_0425740_0432040 so western governments are providing totalitarian governments with tools to do this against their own citizens
ted_01328_0433800_0436590 but western governments are doing it to themselves as well
ted_01328_0436810_0449530 for example in germany just a couple of weeks ago the socalled state trojan was found which was a trojan used by german government officials to investigate their own citizens
ted_01328_0449620_0455740 if you are a suspect in a criminal case well it &apos;s pretty obvious your phone will be tapped
ted_01328_0455780_0458240 but today it goes beyond that
ted_01328_0458260_0459880 they will tap your internet connection
ted_01328_0459900_0474430 they will even use tools like state trojan to infect your computer with a trojan which enables them to watch all your communication to listen to your online discussions to collect your passwords
ted_01328_0478460_0494970 now when we think deeper about things like these the obvious response from people should be ok well that sounds bad but that doesn &apos;t really affect me because i &apos;m a legal citizen
ted_01328_0495480_0496520 why should i worry
ted_01328_0496550_0510100 because i have nothing to hide and this is an argument which doesn &apos;t make sense privacy is implied privacy is not up for discussion
ted_01328_0511190_0518940 this is not a question between privacy against security
ted_01328_0520360_0525160 it &apos;s a question of freedom against control
ted_01328_0526700_0536290 and while we might trust our governments right now right here in 2011 any rights we give away will be given away for good
ted_01328_0536920_0544220 and do we trust do we blindly trust any future government a government we might have 50 years from now
ted_01328_0548180_0552900 and these are the questions that we have to worry about for the next 50 years
ted_01330_0017460_0020070 do you know how many choices you make in a typical day
ted_01330_0020070_0020570 do you know how many choices you make in typical week
ted_01330_0021860_0031100 i recently did a survey with over 2000 americans and the average number of choices that the typical american reports making is about 70 in a typical day
ted_01330_0031100_0038780 there was also recently a study done with ceos in which they followed ceos around for a whole week
ted_01330_0039780_0047980 and these scientists simply documented all the various tasks that these ceos engaged in and how much time they spent engaging in making decisions related to these tasks
ted_01330_0048910_0054320 and they found that the average ceo engaged in about 139 tasks in a week
ted_01330_0054530_0058120 each task was made up of many many many subchoices of course
ted_01330_0058790_0062470 50 percent of their decisions were made in nine minutes or less
ted_01330_0064140_0069410 only about 12 percent of the decisions did they make an hour or more of their time
ted_01330_0070860_0072110 think about your own choices
ted_01330_0072710_0077590 do you know how many choices make it into your nine minute category versus your one hour category
ted_01330_0078540_0081860 how well do you think you &apos;re doing at managing those choices
ted_01330_0083620_0089950 today i want to talk about one of the biggest modern day choosing problems that we have which is the choice overload problem
ted_01330_0090640_0093910 i want to talk about the problem and some potential solutions
ted_01330_0095010_0100230 now as i talk about this problem i &apos;m going to have some questions for you and i &apos;m going to want to know your answers
ted_01330_0101350_0117040 so when i ask you a question since i &apos;m blind only raise your hand if you want to burn off some calories laughter otherwise when i ask you a question and if your answer is yes i &apos;d like you to clap your hands
ted_01330_0117720_0126730 so for my first question for you today are you guys ready to hear about the choice overload problem applause thank you
ted_01330_0127690_0135580 so when i was a graduate student at stanford university i used to go to this very very upscale grocery store at least at that time it was truly upscale
ted_01330_0136250_0141340 it was a store called draeger &apos;s now this store it was almost like going to an amusement park
ted_01330_0141450_0154320 they had 250 different kinds of mustards and vinegars and over 500 different kinds of fruits and vegetables and more than two dozen different kinds of bottled water and this was during a time when we actually used to drink tap water
ted_01330_0155560_0162490 i used to love going to this store but on one occasion i asked myself well how come you never buy anything
ted_01330_0162800_0164020 here &apos;s their olive oil aisle
ted_01330_0164360_0171280 they had over 75 different kinds of olive oil including those that were in a locked case that came from thousandyearold olive trees
ted_01330_0172300_0185030 so i one day decided to pay a visit to the manager and i asked the manager is this model of offering people all this choice really working and he pointed to the busloads of tourists that would show up everyday with cameras ready usually
ted_01330_0185730_0190320 we decided to do a little experiment and we picked jam for our experiment
ted_01330_0190490_0191450 here &apos;s their jam aisle
ted_01330_0191460_0193860 they had 348 different kinds of jam
ted_01330_0194230_0197830 we set up a little tasting booth right near the entrance of the store
ted_01330_0198050_0210320 we there put out six different flavors of jam or 24 different flavors of jam and we looked at two things first in which case were people more likely to stop sample some jam
ted_01330_0210890_0216600 more people stopped when there were 24 about 60 percent than when there were six about 40 percent
ted_01330_0217820_0223040 the next thing we looked at is in which case were people more likely to buy a jar of jam
ted_01330_0223400_0225030 now we see the opposite effect
ted_01330_0225410_0230410 of the people who stopped when there were 24 only three percent of them actually bought a jar of jam
ted_01330_0230810_0237840 of the people who stopped when there were six well now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a jar of jam
ted_01330_0238260_0246190 now if you do the math people were at least six times more likely to buy a jar of jam if they encountered six than if they encountered 24
ted_01330_0247010_0258120 now choosing not to buy a jar of jam is probably good for us at least it &apos;s good for our waistlines but it turns out that this choice overload problem affects us even in very consequential decisions
ted_01330_0258190_0262770 we choose not to choose even when it goes against our best selfinterests
ted_01330_0263520_0266390 so now for the topic of today financial savings
ted_01330_0267150_0297280 now i &apos;m going to describe to you a study i did with gur huberman emir kamenica wei jang where we looked at the retirement savings decisions of nearly a million americans from about 650 plans all in the us and what we looked at was whether the number of fund offerings available in a retirement savings plan the 401 k plan does that affect people &apos;s likelihood to save more for tomorrow
ted_01330_0298140_0302070 and what we found was that indeed there was a correlation
ted_01330_0302270_0310480 so in these plans we had about 657 plans that ranged from offering people anywhere from two to 59 different fund offerings
ted_01330_0311080_0317220 and what we found was that the more funds offered indeed there was less participation rate
ted_01330_0317250_0326020 so if you look at the extremes those plans that offered you two funds participation rates were around in the mid70s still not as high as we want it to be
ted_01330_0326880_0333770 in those plans that offered nearly 60 funds participation rates have now dropped to about the 60th percentile
ted_01330_0335240_0345090 now it turns out that even if you do choose to participate when there are more choices present even then it has negative consequences
ted_01330_0346150_0355010 so for those people who did choose to participate the more choices available the more likely people were to completely avoid stocks or equity funds
ted_01330_0355700_0360840 the more choices available the more likely they were to put all their money in pure money market accounts
ted_01330_0361250_0370390 now neither of these extreme decisions are the kinds of decisions that any of us would recommend for people when you &apos;re considering their future financial wellbeing
ted_01330_0370970_0378340 well over the past decade we have observed three main negative consequences to offering people more and more choices
ted_01330_0379070_0383720 they &apos;re more likely to delay choosing procrastinate even when it goes against their best selfinterest
ted_01330_0383950_0394010 they &apos;re more likely to make worse choices worse financial choices medical choices they &apos;re more likely to choose things that make them less satisfied even when they do objectively better
ted_01330_0394510_0408580 the main reason for this is because we might enjoy gazing at those giant walls of mayonnaises mustards vinegars jams but we can &apos;t actually do the math of comparing and contrasting and actually picking from that stunning display
ted_01330_0409750_0422250 so what i want to propose to you today are four simple techniques techniques that we have tested in one way or another in different research venues that you can easily apply in your businesses
ted_01330_0423300_0430790 the first cut you &apos;ve heard it said before but it &apos;s never been more true than today that less is more
ted_01330_0431780_0436810 people are always upset when i say cut they &apos;re always worried they &apos;re going to lose shelf space
ted_01330_0436880_0451100 but in fact what we &apos;re seeing more and more is that if you are willing to cut get rid of those extraneous redundant options well there &apos;s an increase in sales there &apos;s a lowering of costs there is an improvement of the choosing experience
ted_01330_0451850_0458400 when proctor amp gamble went from 26 different kinds of head amp shoulders to 15 they saw an increase in sales by 10 percent
ted_01330_0458670_0469810 when the golden cat corporation got rid of their 10 worstselling cat litter products they saw an increase in profits by 87 percent a function of both increase in sales and lowering of costs
ted_01330_0469410_0473730 you know the average grocery store today offers you 45000 products
ted_01330_0473740_0476170 the typical walmart today offers you 100000 products
ted_01330_0476410_0490370 but the ninth largest retailer the ninth biggest retailer in the world today is aldi and it offers you only 1400 products one kind of canned tomato sauce
ted_01330_0490370_0504810 now in the financial savings world i think one of the best examples that has recently come out on how to best manage the choice offerings has actually been something that david laibson was heavily involved in designing which was the program that they have at harvard
ted_01330_0504820_0509650 every single harvard employee is now automatically enrolled in a lifecycle fund
ted_01330_0509650_0516430 for those people who actually want to choose they &apos;re given 20 funds not 300 or more funds
ted_01330_0516430_0520240 you know often people say i don &apos;t know how to cut
ted_01330_0520240_0528010 they &apos;re all important choices and the first thing i do is i ask the employees tell me how these choices are different from one another
ted_01330_0528010_0531000 and if your employees can &apos;t tell them apart neither can your consumers
ted_01330_0531010_0537030 now before we started our session this afternoon i had a chat with gary
ted_01330_0537030_0548140 and gary said that he would be willing to offer people in this audience an allexpensespaid free vacation to the most beautiful road in the world
ted_01330_0548160_0551360 here &apos;s a description of the road
ted_01330_0551360_0554110 and i &apos;d like you to read it
ted_01330_0554110_0560870 and now i &apos;ll give you a few seconds to read it and then i want you to clap your hands if you &apos;re ready to take gary up on his offer light clapping okay
ted_01330_0562960_0590750 anybody who &apos;s ready to take him up on his offer is that all all right let me show you some more about this laughter you guys knew there was a trick didn &apos;t you honk now who &apos;s ready to go on this trip applause laughter i think i might have actually heard more hands
ted_01330_0591450_0605240 all right now in fact you had objectively more information the first time around than the second time around but i would venture to guess that you felt that it was more real the second time around
ted_01330_0605240_0609710 because the pictures made it feel more real to you
ted_01330_0609710_0615460 which brings me to the second technique for handling the choice overload problem which is concretization
ted_01330_0615460_0630940 that in order for people to understand the differences between the choices they have to be able to understand the consequences associated with each choice and that the consequences need to be felt in a vivid sort of way in a very concrete way
ted_01330_0630940_0639670 why do people spend an average of 15 to 30 percent more when they use an atm card or a credit card as opposed to cash
ted_01330_0639670_0641500 because it doesn &apos;t feel like real money
ted_01330_0641500_0649650 and it turns out that making it feel more concrete can actually be a very positive tool to use in getting people to save more
ted_01330_0649650_0665580 so a study that i did with shlomo benartzi and alessandro previtero we did a study with people at ing employees that are all working at ing and now these people were all in a session where they &apos;re doing enrollment for their 401 k plan
ted_01330_0665580_0671680 and during that session we kept the session exactly the way it used to be but we added one little thing
ted_01330_0671700_0682050 the one little thing we added was we asked people to just think about all the positive things that would happen in your life if you saved more
ted_01330_0682050_0695490 by doing that simple thing there was an increase in enrollment by 20 percent and there was an increase in the amount of people willing to save or the amount that they were willing to put down into their savings account by four percent
ted_01330_0695500_0698250 the third technique categorization
ted_01330_0698250_0703670 we can handle more categories than we can handle choices
ted_01330_0703670_0708220 so for example here &apos;s a study we did in a magazine aisle
ted_01330_0708220_0718500 it turns out that in wegmans grocery stores up and down the northeast corridor the magazine aisles range anywhere from 331 different kinds of magazines all the way up to 664
ted_01330_0718500_0720930 but you know what
ted_01330_0720930_0738880 if i show you 600 magazines and i divide them up into 10 categories versus i show you 400 magazines and divide them up into 20 categories you believe that i have given you more choice and a better choosing experience if i gave you the 400 than if i gave you the 600
ted_01330_0738880_0742330 because the categories tell me how to tell them apart
ted_01330_0742330_0746860 here are two different jewelry displays
ted_01330_0746860_0761180 one is called jazz and the other one is called swing if you think the display on the left is swing and the display on the right is jazz clap your hands light clapping okay there &apos;s some
ted_01330_0761460_0766180 if you think the one on the left is jazz and the one on the right is swing clap your hands
ted_01330_0766180_0768000 okay a bit more
ted_01330_0768180_0770200 now it turns out you &apos;re right
ted_01330_0770200_0774160 the one on the left is jazz and the one on the right is swing but you know what
ted_01330_0774810_0785070 this is a highly useless categorization scheme laughter the categories need to say something to the chooser not the choicemaker
ted_01330_0785170_0790560 and you often see that problem when it comes down to those long lists of all these funds
ted_01330_0790560_0793120 who are they actually supposed to be informing
ted_01330_0793130_0796650 my fourth technique condition for complexity
ted_01330_0796690_0803420 it turns out we can actually handle a lot more information than we think we can we &apos;ve just got to take it a little easier
ted_01330_0803420_0806180 we have to gradually increase the complexity
ted_01330_0806210_0809590 i &apos;m going to show you one example of what i &apos;m talking about
ted_01330_0809590_0813160 let &apos;s take a very very complicated decision buying a car
ted_01330_0813160_0818870 here &apos;s a german car manufacturer that gives you the opportunity to completely custom make your car
ted_01330_0818870_0822790 you &apos;ve got to make 60 different decisions completely make up your car
ted_01330_0822790_0826820 now these decisions vary in the number of choices that they offer per decision
ted_01330_0826860_0830350 car colors exterior car colors i &apos;ve got 56 choices
ted_01330_0830350_0832910 engines gearshift four choices
ted_01330_0833170_0839410 so now what i &apos;m going to do is i &apos;m going to vary the order in which these decisions appear
ted_01330_0839430_0845650 so half of the customers are going to go from high choice 56 car colors to low choice four gearshifts
ted_01330_0845660_0853000 the other half of the customers are going to go from low choice four gearshifts to 56 car colors high choice
ted_01330_0853000_0855850 what am i going to look at
ted_01330_0855850_0857480 how engaged you are
ted_01330_0857510_0864050 if you keep hitting the default button per decision that means you &apos;re getting overwhelmed that means i &apos;m losing you
ted_01330_0864050_0877120 what you find is the people who go from high choice to low choice they &apos;re hitting that default button over and over and over again we &apos;re losing them they go from low choice to high choice they &apos;re hanging in there
ted_01330_0877120_0878230 it &apos;s the same information
ted_01330_0878250_0881140 it &apos;s the same number of choices
ted_01330_0881140_0886070 the only thing that i have done is i have varied the order in which that information is presented
ted_01330_0886070_0890370 if i start you off easy i learn how to choose
ted_01330_0890370_0899950 even though choosing gearshift doesn &apos;t tell me anything about my preferences for interior decor it still prepares me for how to choose
ted_01330_0899960_0905980 it also gets me excited about this big product that i &apos;m putting together so i &apos;m more willing to be motivated to be engaged
ted_01330_0905980_0924850 so let me recap i have talked about four techniques for mitigating the problem of choice overload cut get rid of the extraneous alternatives concretize make it real categorize we can handle more categories less choices condition for complexity
ted_01330_0925200_0938320 all of these techniques that i &apos;m describing to you today are designed to help you manage your choices better for you you can use them on yourself better for the people that you are serving
ted_01330_0938320_0944010 because i believe that the key to getting the most from choice is to be choosy about choosing
ted_01330_0944010_0951630 and the more we &apos;re able to be choosy about choosing the better we will be able to practice the art of choosing
ted_01330_0951660_0953280 thank you very much
ted_01330_0953210_0953410 applause
ted_01337_0012800_0017680 i think we have to do something about a piece of the culture of medicine that has to change
ted_01337_0018220_0020620 and i think it starts with one physician and that &apos;s me
ted_01337_0020650_0026030 and maybe i &apos;ve been around long enough that i can afford to give away some of my false prestige to be able to do that
ted_01337_0027080_0035440 before i actually begin the meat of my talk let &apos;s begin with a bit of baseball hey why not we &apos;re near the end we &apos;re getting close to the world series
ted_01337_0035640_0043180 we all love baseball don &apos;t we laughter baseball is filled with some amazing statistics
ted_01337_0043230_0051720 and there &apos;s hundreds of them moneyball is about to come out and it &apos;s all about statistics and using statistics to build a great baseball team
ted_01337_0052110_0056330 i &apos;m going to focus on one stat that i hope a lot of you have heard of
ted_01337_0056520_0057760 it &apos;s called batting average
ted_01337_0058290_0061800 so we talk about a 300 a batter who bats 300
ted_01337_0061800_0068210 that means that ballplayer batted safely hit safely three times out of 10 at bats
ted_01337_0068770_0076530 that means hit the ball into the outfield it dropped it didn &apos;t get caught and whoever tried to throw it to first base didn &apos;t get there in time and the runner was safe
ted_01337_0076940_0079880 three times out of 10
ted_01337_0080030_0084990 do you know what they call a 300 hitter in major league baseball
ted_01337_0086060_0090260 good really good maybe an allstar
ted_01337_0091610_0095250 do you know what they call a 400 baseball hitter
ted_01337_0095340_0108340 that &apos;s somebody who hit by the way four times safely out of every 10 legendary as in ted williams legendary the last major league baseball player to hit over 400 during a regular season
ted_01337_0109540_0116810 now let &apos;s take this back into my world of medicine where i &apos;m a lot more comfortable or perhaps a bit less comfortable after what i &apos;m going to talk to you about
ted_01337_0118500_0130090 suppose you have appendicitis and you &apos;re referred to a surgeon who &apos;s batting 400 on appendectomies laughter somehow this isn &apos;t working out is it
ted_01337_0130470_0146750 now suppose you live in a certain part of a certain remote place and you have a loved one who has blockages in two coronary arteries and your family doctor refers that loved one to a cardiologist who &apos;s batting 200 on angioplasties
ted_01337_0147460_0148760 but but you know what
ted_01337_0148780_0150080 she &apos;s doing a lot better this year
ted_01337_0150080_0151160 she &apos;s on the comeback trail
ted_01337_0151160_0155030 and she &apos;s hitting a 257
ted_01337_0155030_0156390 somehow this isn &apos;t working
ted_01337_0156530_0158160 but i &apos;m going to ask you a question
ted_01337_0158810_0165490 what do you think a batting average for a cardiac surgeon or a nurse practitioner or an orthopedic surgeon an obgyn a paramedic is supposed to be
ted_01337_0165490_0171310 1000 very good
ted_01337_0171310_0181140 now truth of the matter is nobody knows in all of medicine what a good surgeon or physician or paramedic is supposed to bat
ted_01337_0182680_0188260 what we do though is we send each one of them including myself out into the world with the admonition be perfect
ted_01337_0188270_0193290 never ever ever make a mistake but you worry about the details about how that &apos;s going to happen
ted_01337_0194050_0197220 and that was the message that i absorbed when i was in med school
ted_01337_0197360_0200010 i was an obsessive compulsive student
ted_01337_0200570_0209290 in high school a classmate once said that brian goldman would study for a blood test laughter and so i did
ted_01337_0210630_0215770 and i studied in my little garret at the nurses &apos; residence at toronto general hospital not far from here
ted_01337_0216080_0218180 and i memorized everything
ted_01337_0218450_0228580 i memorized in my anatomy class the origins and exertions of every muscle every branch of every artery that came off the aorta differential diagnoses obscure and common
ted_01337_0228810_0233030 i even knew the differential diagnosis in how to classify renal tubular acidosis
ted_01337_0233380_0236180 and all the while i was amassing more and more knowledge
ted_01337_0236620_0239540 and i did well i graduated with honors cum laude
ted_01337_0240540_0253730 and i came out of medical school with the impression that if i memorized everything and knew everything or as much as possible as close to everything as possible that it would immunize me against making mistakes
ted_01337_0254950_0260510 and it worked for a while until i met mrs drucker
ted_01337_0262460_0269140 i was a resident at a teaching hospital here in toronto when mrs drucker was brought to the emergency department of the hospital where i was working
ted_01337_0269600_0273540 at the time i was assigned to the cardiology service on a cardiology rotation
ted_01337_0274080_0281700 and it was my job when the emergency staff called for a cardiology consult to see that patient in emerg and to report back to my attending
ted_01337_0282430_0285080 and i saw mrs drucker and she was breathless
ted_01337_0285080_0288010 and when i listened to her she was making a wheezy sound
ted_01337_0288010_0295710 and when i listened to her chest with a stethoscope i could hear crackly sounds on both sides that told me that she was in congestive heart failure
ted_01337_0296110_0305340 this is a condition in which the heart fails and instead of being able to pump all the blood forward some of the blood backs up into the lung the lungs fill up with blood and that &apos;s why you have shortness of breath
ted_01337_0306060_0308030 and that wasn &apos;t a difficult diagnosis to make
ted_01337_0308030_0311000 i made it and i set to work treating her
ted_01337_0311000_0314330 i gave her aspirin i gave her medications to relieve the strain on her heart
ted_01337_0314370_0320340 i gave her medications that we call diuretics water pills to get her to pee out the access fluid
ted_01337_0320850_0323940 and over the course of the next hour and a half or two she started to feel better
ted_01337_0324960_0326020 and i felt really good
ted_01337_0327280_0332040 and that &apos;s when i made my first mistake i sent her home
ted_01337_0333160_0335030 actually i made two more mistakes
ted_01337_0335670_0338950 i sent her home without speaking to my attending
ted_01337_0339760_0347550 i didn &apos;t pick up the phone and do what i was supposed to do which was call my attending and run the story by him so he would have a chance to see her for himself
ted_01337_0347670_0350850 and he knew her he would have been able to furnish additional information about her
ted_01337_0352840_0354220 maybe i did it for a good reason
ted_01337_0354820_0357300 maybe i didn &apos;t want to be a highmaintenance resident
ted_01337_0357330_0367020 maybe i wanted to be so successful and so able to take responsibility that i would do so and i would be able to take care of my attending &apos;s patients without even having to contact him
ted_01337_0368540_0370520 the second mistake that i made was worse
ted_01337_0371920_0378980 in sending her home i disregarded a little voice deep down inside that was trying to tell me goldman not a good idea
ted_01337_0379190_0396680 don &apos;t do this in fact so lacking in confidence was i that i actually asked the nurse who was looking after mrs drucker do you think it &apos;s okay if she goes home and the nurse thought about it and said very matteroffactly yeah i think she &apos;ll do okay i can remember that like it was yesterday
ted_01337_0397720_0402210 so i signed the discharge papers and an ambulance came paramedics came to take her home
ted_01337_0402770_0404210 and i went back to my work on the wards
ted_01337_0406050_0412350 all the rest of that day that afternoon i had this kind of gnawing feeling inside my stomach
ted_01337_0413130_0414770 but i carried on with my work
ted_01337_0414890_0424220 and at the end of the day i packed up to leave the hospital and walked to the parking lot to take my car and drive home when i did something that i don &apos;t usually do
ted_01337_0425420_0428010 i walked through the emergency department on my way home
ted_01337_0428940_0440850 and it was there that another nurse not the nurse who was looking after mrs drucker before but another nurse said three words to me that are the three words that most emergency physicians i know dread
ted_01337_0441520_0447670 others in medicine dread them as well but there &apos;s something particular about emergency medicine because we see patients so fleetingly
ted_01337_0449390_0464050 the three words are do you remember do you remember that patient you sent home the other nurse asked matteroffactly well she &apos;s back in just that tone of voice
ted_01337_0465120_0466260 well she was back all right
ted_01337_0466660_0467760 she was back and near death
ted_01337_0470260_0482740 about an hour after she had arrived home after i &apos;d sent her home she collapsed and her family called 911 and the paramedics brought her back to the emergency department where she had a blood pressure of 50 which is in severe shock
ted_01337_0483210_0485100 and she was barely breathing and she was blue
ted_01337_0485330_0488340 and the emerg staff pulled out all the stops
ted_01337_0488770_0490820 they gave her medications to raise her blood pressure
ted_01337_0491240_0493070 they put her on a ventilator
ted_01337_0493660_0498480 and i was shocked and shaken to the core
ted_01337_0498950_0505980 and i went through this roller coaster because after they stabilized her she went to the intensive care unit and i hoped against hope that she would recover
ted_01337_0507070_0510500 and over the next two or three days it was clear that she was never going to wake up
ted_01337_0510710_0512340 she had irreversible brain damage
ted_01337_0514180_0515630 and the family gathered
ted_01337_0515930_0520210 and over the course of the next eight or nine days they resigned themselves to what was happening
ted_01337_0520210_0529450 and at about the nine day mark they let her go mrs drucker a wife a mother and a grandmother
ted_01337_0531150_0534260 they say you never forget the names of those who die
ted_01337_0534280_0536810 and that was my first time to be acquainted with that
ted_01337_0538060_0555590 over the next few weeks i beat myself up and i experienced for the first time the unhealthy shame that exists in our culture of medicine where i felt alone isolated not feeling the healthy kind of shame that you feel because you can &apos;t talk about it with your colleagues
ted_01337_0555790_0571750 you know that healthy kind when you betray a secret that a best friend made you promise never to reveal and then you get busted and then your best friend confronts you and you have terrible discussions but at the end of it all that sick feeling guides you and you say i &apos;ll never make that mistake again
ted_01337_0572210_0574340 and you make amends and you never make that mistake again
ted_01337_0574550_0577530 that &apos;s the kind of shame that is a teacher
ted_01337_0578150_0582050 the unhealthy shame i &apos;m talking about is the one that makes you so sick inside
ted_01337_0582500_0587800 it &apos;s the one that says not that what you did was bad but that you are bad
ted_01337_0588750_0591580 and it was what i was feeling
ted_01337_0591850_0594540 and it wasn &apos;t because of my attending he was a doll
ted_01337_0594540_0599000 he talked to the family and i &apos;m quite sure that he smoothed things over and made sure that i didn &apos;t get sued
ted_01337_0600670_0605310 and i kept asking myself these questions why didn &apos;t i ask my attending
ted_01337_0605400_0611560 why did i send her home and then at my worst moments why did i make such a stupid mistake
ted_01337_0611720_0612850 why did i go into medicine
ted_01337_0613760_0616580 slowly but surely it lifted
ted_01337_0617490_0618780 i began to feel a bit better
ted_01337_0619140_0626990 and on a cloudy day there was a crack in the clouds and the sun started to come out and i wondered maybe i could feel better again
ted_01337_0627190_0642800 and i made myself a bargain that if only i redouble my efforts to be perfect and never make another mistake again please make the voices stop and they did and i went back to work
ted_01337_0644440_0645330 and then it happened again
ted_01337_0646790_0654230 two years later i was an attending in the emergency department at a community hospital just north of toronto and i saw a 25 yearold man with a sore throat
ted_01337_0654240_0656210 it was busy i was in a bit of a hurry
ted_01337_0656580_0657720 he kept pointing here
ted_01337_0658800_0660440 i looked at his throat it was a little bit pink
ted_01337_0661200_0664310 and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him on his way
ted_01337_0664890_0668100 and even as he was walking out the door he was still sort of pointing to his throat
ted_01337_0669400_0675850 and two days later i came to do my next emergency shift and that &apos;s when my chief asked to speak to me quietly in her office
ted_01337_0676250_0688020 and she said the three words do you remember do you remember that patient you saw with the sore throat well it turns out he didn &apos;t have a strep throat
ted_01337_0688030_0690750 he had a potentially lifethreatening condition called epiglottitis
ted_01337_0692330_0698260 you can google it but it &apos;s an infection not of the throat but of the upper airway and it can actually cause the airway to close
ted_01337_0699240_0701850 and fortunately he didn &apos;t die
ted_01337_0701870_0707640 he was placed on intravenous antibiotics and he recovered after a few days
ted_01337_0707760_0719710 and i went through the same period of shame and recriminations and felt cleansed and went back to work until it happened again and again and again
ted_01337_0720750_0723720 twice in one emergency shift i missed appendicitis
ted_01337_0724260_0730920 now that takes some doing especially when you work in a hospital that at the time saw but 14 people a night
ted_01337_0732150_0736880 now in both cases i didn &apos;t send them home and i don &apos;t think there was any gap in their care
ted_01337_0736900_0738430 one i thought had a kidney stone
ted_01337_0738770_0739910 i ordered a kidney xray
ted_01337_0739910_0746780 when it turned out to be normal my colleague who was doing a reassessment of the patient noticed some tenderness in the right lower quadrant and called the surgeons
ted_01337_0746840_0748340 the other one had a lot of diarrhea
ted_01337_0748440_0754620 i ordered some fluids to rehydrate him and asked my colleague to reassess him
ted_01337_0754620_0758240 and he did and when he noticed some tenderness in the right lower quadrant called the surgeons
ted_01337_0758790_0763110 in both cases they had their operations and they did okay
ted_01337_0763730_0766700 but each time they were gnawing at me eating at me
ted_01337_0767360_0779260 and i &apos;d like to be able to say to you that my worst mistakes only happened in the first five years of practice as many of my colleagues say which is total bs laughter some of my doozies have been in the last five years
ted_01337_0783290_0785830 alone ashamed and unsupported
ted_01337_0786020_0799370 here &apos;s the problem if i can &apos;t come clean and talk about my mistakes if i can &apos;t find the stillsmall voice that tells me what really happened how can i share it with my colleagues
ted_01337_0800290_0804540 how can i teach them about what i did so that they don &apos;t do the same thing
ted_01337_0806770_0810980 if i were to walk into a room like right now i have no idea what you think of me
ted_01337_0811710_0815570 when was the last time you heard somebody talk about failure after failure after failure
ted_01337_0816240_0822850 oh yeah you go to a cocktail party and you might hear about some other doctor but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody talking about their own mistakes
ted_01337_0823380_0840000 if i were to walk into a room filled with my colleages and ask for their support right now and start to tell what i &apos;ve just told you right now i probably wouldn &apos;t get through two of those stories before they would start to get really uncomfortable somebody would crack a joke they &apos;d change the subject and we would move on
ted_01337_0842440_0852890 and in fact if i knew and my colleagues knew that one of my orthopedic colleagues took off the wrong leg in my hospital believe me i &apos;d have trouble making eye contact with that person
ted_01337_0854080_0855590 that &apos;s the system that we have
ted_01337_0855590_0857290 it &apos;s a complete denial of mistakes
ted_01337_0858270_0875670 it &apos;s a system in which there are two kinds of physicians those who make mistakes and those who don &apos;t those who can &apos;t handle sleep deprivation and those who can those who have lousy outcomes and those who have great outcomes
ted_01337_0876470_0881670 and it &apos;s almost like an ideological reaction like the antibodies begin to attack that person
ted_01337_0882410_0891050 and we have this idea that if we drive the people who make mistakes out of medicine what will we be left with but a safe system
ted_01337_0892640_0894480 but there are two problems with that
ted_01337_0895490_0914660 in my 20 years or so of medical broadcasting and journalism i &apos;ve made a personal study of medical malpractice and medical errors to learn everything i can from one of the first articles i wrote for the toronto star to my show white coat black art and what i &apos;ve learned is that errors are absolutely ubiquitous
ted_01337_0916420_0930600 we work in a system where errors happen every day where one in 10 medications are either the wrong medication given in hospital or at the wrong dosage where hospitalacquired infections are getting more and more numerous causing havoc and death
ted_01337_0931770_0937170 in this country as many as 24000 canadians die of preventable medical errors
ted_01337_0937170_0940870 in the united states the institute of medicine pegged it at 100000
ted_01337_0941020_0947230 in both cases these are gross underestimates because we really aren &apos;t ferreting out the problem as we should
ted_01337_0949250_0959440 and here &apos;s the thing in a hospital system where medical knowledge is doubling every two or three years we can &apos;t keep up with it
ted_01337_0959760_0962750 sleep deprivation is absolutely pervasive
ted_01337_0963020_0964210 we can &apos;t get rid of it
ted_01337_0964760_0970010 we have our cognitive biases so that i can take a perfect history on a patient with chest pain
ted_01337_0970130_0977580 now take the same patient with chest pain make them moist and garrulous and put a little bit of alcohol on their breath and suddenly my history is laced with contempt
ted_01337_0978380_0979910 i don &apos;t take the same history
ted_01337_0980300_0983320 i &apos;m not a robot i don &apos;t do things the same way each time
ted_01337_0983550_0987640 and my patients aren &apos;t cars they don &apos;t tell me their symptoms in the same way each time
ted_01337_0987950_0990190 given all of that mistakes are inevitable
ted_01337_0990770_1001140 so if you take the system as i was taught and weed out all the errorprone health professionals well there won &apos;t be anybody left
ted_01337_1003240_1010010 and you know that business about people not wanting to talk about their worst cases
ted_01337_1010550_1024740 on my show on white coat black art i made it a habit of saying here &apos;s my worst mistake i would say to everybody from paramedics to the chief of cardiac surgery here &apos;s my worst mistake blah blah blah blah blah what about yours and i would point the microphone towards them
ted_01337_1025210_1036100 and their pupils would dilate they would recoil then they would look down and swallow hard and start to tell me their stories they want to tell their stories
ted_01337_1036140_1037480 they want to share their stories
ted_01337_1037490_1043500 they want to be able to say look don &apos;t make the same mistake i did what they need is an environment to be able to do that
ted_01337_1043670_1047210 what they need is a redefined medical culture
ted_01337_1047780_1050970 and it starts with one physician at a time
ted_01337_1051300_1063230 the redefined physician is human knows she &apos;s human accepts it isn &apos;t proud of making mistakes but strives to learn one thing from what happened that she can teach to somebody else
ted_01337_1063910_1065930 she shares her experience with others
ted_01337_1065940_1068550 she &apos;s supportive when other people talk about their mistakes
ted_01337_1069190_1076520 and she points out other people &apos;s mistakes not in a gotcha way but in a loving supportive way so that everybody can benefit
ted_01337_1077420_1086470 and she works in a culture of medicine that acknowledges that human beings run the system and when human beings run the system they will make mistakes from time to time
ted_01337_1086810_1117630 so the system is evolving to create backups that make it easier to detect those mistakes that humans inevitably make and also fosters in a loving supportive way places where everybody who is observing in the health care system can actually point out things that could be potential mistakes and is rewarded for doing so and especially people like me when we do make mistakes we &apos;re rewarded for coming clean
ted_01337_1119340_1120660 my name is brian goldman
ted_01337_1122390_1133310 i am a redefined physician i &apos;m human i make mistakes i &apos;m sorry about that but i strive to learn one thing that i can pass on to other people
ted_01337_1134880_1138330 i still don &apos;t know what you think of me but i can live with that
ted_01337_1139790_1145600 and let me close with three words of my own i do remember applause
ted_01346_0013760_0042360 because i usually take the role of trying to explain to people how wonderful the new technologies that are coming along are going to be and i thought that since i was among friends here i would tell you what i really think and try to look back and try to understand what is really going on here with these amazing jumps in technology that seem so fast that we can barely keep on top of it
ted_01346_0042810_0046450 so i &apos;m going to start out by showing just one very boring technology slide
ted_01346_0047060_0051120 and then so if you can just turn on the slide that &apos;s on
ted_01346_0053520_0057480 this is just a random slide that i picked out of my file
ted_01346_0057940_0061990 what i want to show you is not so much the details of the slide but the general form of it
ted_01346_0062000_0070470 this happens to be a slide of some analysis that we were doing about the power of risc microprocessors versus the power of local area networks
ted_01346_0071320_0082160 and the interesting thing about it is that this slide like so many technology slides that we &apos;re used to is a sort of a straight line on a semilog curve
ted_01346_0083170_0087700 in other words every step here represents an order of magnitude in performance scale
ted_01346_0088640_0094160 and this is a new thing that we talk about technology on semilog curves
ted_01346_0094720_0096650 something really weird is going on here
ted_01346_0097050_0098980 and that &apos;s basically what i &apos;m going to be talking about
ted_01346_0099170_0100420 so if you could bring up the lights
ted_01346_0100430_0107850 if you could bring up the lights higher because i &apos;m just going to use a piece of paper here
ted_01346_0109090_0112830 now why do we draw technology curves in semilog curves
ted_01346_0113290_0128600 well the answer is if i drew it on a normal curve where let &apos;s say this is years this is time of some sort and this is whatever measure of the technology that i &apos;m trying to graph the graphs look sort of silly
ted_01346_0129340_0130550 they sort of go like this
ted_01346_0133130_0134340 and they don &apos;t tell us much
ted_01346_0135600_0144660 now if i graph for instance some other technology say transportation technology on a semilog curve it would look very stupid it would look like a flat line
ted_01346_0144670_0148840 but when something like this happens things are qualitatively changing
ted_01346_0148860_0160060 so if transportation technology was moving along as fast as microprocessor technology then the day after tomorrow i would be able to get in a taxi cab and be in tokyo in 30 seconds
ted_01346_0161360_0162450 it &apos;s not moving like that
ted_01346_0162460_0170660 and there &apos;s nothing precedented in the history of technology development of this kind of selffeeding growth where you go by orders of magnitude every few years
ted_01346_0171910_0179360 now the question that i &apos;d like to ask is if you look at these exponential curves they don &apos;t go on forever
ted_01346_0181200_0185000 things just can &apos;t possibly keep changing as fast as they are
ted_01346_0185540_0187210 one of two things is going to happen
ted_01346_0188100_0198450 either it &apos;s going to turn into a sort of classical scurve like this until something totally different comes along or maybe it &apos;s going to do this
ted_01346_0199470_0200780 that &apos;s about all it can do
ted_01346_0201270_0205560 now i &apos;m an optimist so i sort of think it &apos;s probably going to do something like that
ted_01346_0206210_0210610 if so that means that what we &apos;re in the middle of right now is a transition
ted_01346_0210640_0217570 we &apos;re sort of on this line in a transition from the way the world used to be to some new way that the world is
ted_01346_0217740_0223260 and so what i &apos;m trying to ask what i &apos;ve been asking myself is what &apos;s this new way that the world is
ted_01346_0223290_0225510 what &apos;s that new state that the world is heading toward
ted_01346_0226110_0230480 because the transition seems very very confusing when we &apos;re right in the middle of it
ted_01346_0231630_0241640 now when i was a kid growing up the future was kind of the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000
ted_01346_0241790_0248170 now here &apos;s a conference in which people talk about the future and you notice that the future is still at about the year 2000
ted_01346_0248720_0250020 it &apos;s about as far as we go out
ted_01346_0250750_0258140 so in other words the future has kind of been shrinking one year per year for my whole lifetime
ted_01346_0260140_0265500 now i think that the reason is because we all feel that something &apos;s happening there
ted_01346_0265500_0278090 that transition is happening we can all sense it and we know that it just doesn &apos;t make too much sense to think out 30 50 years because everything &apos;s going to be so different that a simple extrapolation of what we &apos;re doing just doesn &apos;t make any sense at all
ted_01346_0279500_0284980 so what i would like to talk about is what that could be what that transition could be that we &apos;re going through
ted_01346_0286580_0295180 now in order to do that i &apos;m going to have to talk about a bunch of stuff that really has nothing to do with technology and computers
ted_01346_0295220_0300950 because i think the only way to understand this is to really step back and take a long time scale look at things
ted_01346_0301570_0307510 so the time scale that i would like to look at this on is the time scale of life on earth
ted_01346_0307830_0314970 so i think this picture makes sense if you look at it a few billion years at a time
ted_01346_0316690_0325020 so if you go back about two and a half billion years the earth was this big sterile hunk of rock with a lot of chemicals floating around on it
ted_01346_0327190_0332640 and if you look at the way that the chemicals got organized we begin to get a pretty good idea of how they do it
ted_01346_0334310_0348580 and i think that there &apos;s theories that are beginning to understand about how it started with rna but i &apos;m going to tell a sort of simple story of it which is that at that time there were little drops of oil floating around with all kinds of different recipes of chemicals in them
ted_01346_0349700_0358680 and some of those drops of oil had a particular combination of chemicals in them which caused them to incorporate chemicals from the outside and grow the drops of oil
ted_01346_0359550_0363000 and those that were like that started to split and divide
ted_01346_0363630_0367580 and those were the most primitive forms of cells in a sense those little drops of oil
ted_01346_0368550_0375000 but now those drops of oil weren &apos;t really alive as we say it now because every one of them was a little random recipe of chemicals
ted_01346_0375440_0382330 and every time it divided they got sort of unequal division of the chemicals within them
ted_01346_0382900_0384710 and so every drop was a little bit different
ted_01346_0385430_0394380 in fact the drops that were different in a way that caused them to be better at incorporating chemicals around them grew more and incorporated more chemicals and divided more
ted_01346_0394780_0397940 so those tended to live longer get expressed more
ted_01346_0399440_0411260 now that &apos;s sort of just a very simple chemical form of life but when things got interesting was when these drops learned a trick about abstraction
ted_01346_0412360_0418930 somehow by ways that we don &apos;t quite understand these little drops learned to write down information
ted_01346_0419000_0425390 they learned to record the information that was the recipe of the cell onto a particular kind of chemical called dna
ted_01346_0426550_0437180 so in other words they worked out in this mindless sort of evolutionary way a form of writing that let them write down what they were so that that way of writing it down could get copied
ted_01346_0438210_0444570 the amazing thing is that that way of writing seems to have stayed steady since it evolved two and a half billion years ago
ted_01346_0444920_0449790 in fact the recipe for us our genes is exactly that same code and that same way of writing
ted_01346_0450260_0455600 in fact every living creature is written in exactly the same set of letters and the same code
ted_01346_0456180_0461060 in fact one of the things that i did just for amusement purposes is we can now write things in this code
ted_01346_0461790_0485760 and i &apos;ve got here a little 100 micrograms of white powder which i try not to let the security people see at airports laughter but this has in it what i did is i took this code the code has standard letters that we use for symbolizing it and i wrote my business card onto a piece of dna and amplified it 10 to the 22 times
ted_01346_0486580_0508040 so if anyone would like a hundred million copies of my business card i have plenty for everyone in the room and in fact everyone in the world and it &apos;s right here laughter if i had really been a egotist i would have put it into a virus and released it in the room
ted_01346_0509535_0509735 laughter
ted_01346_0516200_0517900 so what was the next step
ted_01346_0517900_0519940 writing down the dna was an interesting step
ted_01346_0520900_0524380 and that caused these cells that kept them happy for another billion years
ted_01346_0524890_0534920 but then there was another really interesting step where things became completely different which is these cells started exchanging and communicating information so that they began to get communities of cells
ted_01346_0535320_0538020 i don &apos;t know if you know this but bacteria can actually exchange dna
ted_01346_0538350_0541710 now that &apos;s why for instance antibiotic resistance has evolved
ted_01346_0542320_0554800 some bacteria figured out how to stay away from penicillin and it went around sort of creating its little dna information with other bacteria and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate
ted_01346_0555830_0563020 now what this communication allowed was communities to form that in some sense were in the same boat together they were synergistic
ted_01346_0564440_0575670 so they survived or they failed together which means that if a community was very successful all the individuals in that community were repeated more and they were favored by evolution
ted_01346_0576890_0587940 now the transition point happened when these communities got so close that in fact they got together and decided to write down the whole recipe for the community together on one string of dna
ted_01346_0588930_0592630 and so the next stage that &apos;s interesting in life took about another billion years
ted_01346_0593090_0600870 and at that stage we have multicellular communities communities of lots of different types of cells working together as a single organism
ted_01346_0601150_0603600 and in fact we &apos;re such a multicellular community
ted_01346_0603610_0607450 we have lots of cells that are not out for themselves anymore
ted_01346_0607450_0614080 your skin cell is really useless without a heart cell muscle cell a brain cell and so on
ted_01346_0614860_0623840 so these communities began to evolve so that the interesting level on which evolution was taking place was no longer a cell but a community which we call an organism
ted_01346_0625650_0629580 now the next step that happened is within these communities
ted_01346_0629840_0633330 these communities of cells again began to abstract information
ted_01346_0633800_0638550 and they began building very special structures that did nothing but process information within the community
ted_01346_0639650_0641090 and those are the neural structures
ted_01346_0641100_0646400 so neurons are the information processing apparatus that those communities of cells built up
ted_01346_0647420_0656620 and in fact they began to get specialists in the community and special structures that were responsible for recording understanding learning information
ted_01346_0656630_0660260 and that was the brains and the nervous system of those communities
ted_01346_0660800_0662960 and that gave them an evolutionary advantage
ted_01346_0662990_0674660 because at that point an individual learning could happen within the time span of a single organism instead of over this evolutionary time span
ted_01346_0675250_0682230 so an organism could for instance learn not to eat a certain kind of fruit because it tasted bad and it got sick last time it ate it
ted_01346_0683290_0698530 that could happen within the lifetime of a single organism whereas before they &apos;d built these special information processing structures that would have had to be learned evolutionarily over hundreds of thousands of years by the individuals dying off that ate that kind of fruit
ted_01346_0699180_0706590 so that nervous system the fact that they built these special information structures tremendously sped up the whole process of evolution
ted_01346_0706980_0709890 because evolution could now happen within an individual
ted_01346_0710080_0711700 it could happen in learning time scales
ted_01346_0713050_0717410 but then what happened was the individuals worked out of course tricks of communicating
ted_01346_0718760_0723310 and for example the most sophisticated version that we &apos;re aware of is human language
ted_01346_0723810_0726630 it &apos;s really a pretty amazing invention if you think about it
ted_01346_0726660_0731010 here i have a very complicated messy confused idea in my head
ted_01346_0731470_0739190 i &apos;m sitting here making grunting sounds basically and hopefully constructing a similar messy confused idea in your head that bears some analogy to it
ted_01346_0739980_0746970 but we &apos;re taking something very complicated turning it into sound sequences of sounds and producing something very complicated in your brain
ted_01346_0748140_0754090 so this allows us now to begin to start functioning as a single organism
ted_01346_0755520_0762500 and so in fact what we &apos;ve done is we humanity have started abstracting out
ted_01346_0762510_0771070 we &apos;re going through the same levels that multicellular organisms have gone through abstracting out our methods of recording presenting processing information
ted_01346_0771860_0775580 so for example the invention of language was a tiny step in that direction
ted_01346_0777740_0787380 telephony computers videotapes cdroms and so on are all our specialized mechanisms that we &apos;ve now built within our society for handling that information
ted_01346_0788140_0799850 and it all connects us together into something that is much bigger and much faster and able to evolve than what we were before
ted_01346_0800450_0803290 so now evolution can take place on a scale of microseconds
ted_01346_0804220_0811500 and you saw ty &apos;s little evolutionary example where he sort of did a little bit of evolution on the convolution program right before your eyes
ted_01346_0811940_0814250 so now we &apos;ve speeded up the time scales once again
ted_01346_0814250_0818110 so the first steps of the story that i told you about took a billion years a piece
ted_01346_0818520_0824110 and the next steps like nervous systems and brains took a few hundred million years
ted_01346_0824580_0828840 then the next steps like language and so on took less than a million years
ted_01346_0829220_0832920 and these next steps like electronics seem to be taking only a few decades
ted_01346_0833290_0841720 the process is feeding on itself and becoming i guess autocatalytic is the word for it when something reinforces its rate of change
ted_01346_0841760_0843600 the more it changes the faster it changes
ted_01346_0843600_0847520 and i think that that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing here in this explosion of curve
ted_01346_0847520_0849680 we &apos;re seeing this process feeding back on itself
ted_01346_0850660_0862480 now i design computers for a living and i know that the mechanisms that i use to design computers would be impossible without recent advances in computers
ted_01346_0863210_0870750 so right now what i do is i design objects at such complexity that it &apos;s really impossible for me to design them in the traditional sense
ted_01346_0870750_0873580 i don &apos;t know what every transistor in the connection machine does
ted_01346_0874390_0875640 there are billions of them
ted_01346_0876730_0890660 instead what i do and what the designers at thinking machines do is we think at some level of abstraction and then we hand it to the machine and the machine takes it beyond what we could ever do much farther and faster than we could ever do
ted_01346_0891240_0895130 and in fact sometimes it takes it by methods that we don &apos;t quite even understand
ted_01346_0896130_0902610 one method that &apos;s particularly interesting that i &apos;ve been using a lot lately is evolution itself
ted_01346_0903650_0911160 so what we do is we put inside the machine a process of evolution that takes place on the microsecond time scale
ted_01346_0912060_0920480 so for example in the most extreme cases we can actually evolve a program by starting out with random sequences of instructions
ted_01346_0922070_0925720 say computer would you please make a hundred million random sequences of instructions
ted_01346_0926440_0936720 now would you please run all of those random sequences of instructions run all of those programs and pick out the ones that came closest to doing what i wanted so in other words i define what i wanted
ted_01346_0936720_0939500 let &apos;s say i want to sort numbers as a simple example i &apos;ve done it with
ted_01346_0940260_0943340 so find the programs that come closest to sorting numbers
ted_01346_0944060_0950180 so of course random sequences of instructions are very unlikely to sort numbers so none of them will really do it
ted_01346_0950180_0954080 but one of them by luck may put two numbers in the right order
ted_01346_0954920_0967640 and i say computer would you please now take the 10 percent of those random sequences that did the best job save those kill off the rest and now let &apos;s reproduce the ones that sorted numbers the best
ted_01346_0967640_0980530 and let &apos;s reproduce them by a process of recombination analogous to sex take two programs and they produce children by exchanging their subroutines and the children inherit the traits of the subroutines of the two programs
ted_01346_0981220_0987500 so i &apos;ve got now a new generation of programs that are produced by combinations of the programs that did a little bit better job
ted_01346_0987970_0991420 say please repeat that process score them again
ted_01346_0991480_0993250 introduce some mutations perhaps
ted_01346_0993630_0995960 and try that again and do that for another generation
ted_01346_0996340_0999470 well every one of those generations just takes a few milliseconds
ted_01346_1000280_1008540 so i can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution on that within the computer in a few minutes or in the complicated cases in a few hours
ted_01346_1009100_1013490 at the end of that i end up with programs that are absolutely perfect at sorting numbers
ted_01346_1013920_1018430 in fact they are programs that are much more efficient than programs i could have ever written by hand
ted_01346_1019200_1022340 now if i look at those programs i can &apos;t tell you how they work
ted_01346_1022380_1024350 i &apos;ve tried looking at them and telling you how they work
ted_01346_1024370_1026330 they &apos;re obscure weird programs
ted_01346_1027330_1028610 but they do the job
ted_01346_1028850_1035440 and in fact i know i &apos;m very confident that they do the job because they come from a line of hundreds of thousands of programs that did the job
ted_01346_1035730_1037700 in fact their life depended on doing the job
ted_01346_1044500_1044700 laughter
ted_01346_1044850_1059730 i was riding in a 747 with marvin minsky once and he pulls out this card and says oh look look at this it says &apos; this plane has hundreds of thousands of tiny parts working together to make you a safe flight &apos; doesn &apos;t that make you feel confident
ted_01346_1059690_1059890 laughter
ted_01346_1062410_1066510 in fact we know that the engineering process doesn &apos;t work very well when it gets complicated
ted_01346_1067320_1073460 so we &apos;re beginning to depend on computers to do a process that &apos;s very different than engineering
ted_01346_1073950_1078660 and it lets us produce things of much more complexity than normal engineering lets us produce
ted_01346_1079170_1081400 and yet we don &apos;t quite understand the options of it
ted_01346_1081430_1083100 so in a sense it &apos;s getting ahead of us
ted_01346_1083930_1090390 we &apos;re now using those programs to make much faster computers so that we &apos;ll be able to run this process much faster
ted_01346_1090910_1092490 so it &apos;s feeding back on itself
ted_01346_1093320_1097410 the thing is becoming faster and that &apos;s why i think it seems so confusing
ted_01346_1097410_1100180 because all of these technologies are feeding back on themselves
ted_01346_1100860_1109580 we &apos;re taking off and what we are is we &apos;re at a point in time which is analogous to when singlecelled organisms were turning into multicelled organisms
ted_01346_1110210_1114890 so we &apos;re the amoebas and we can &apos;t quite figure out what the hell this thing is we &apos;re creating
ted_01346_1115000_1116560 we &apos;re right at that point of transition
ted_01346_1117540_1121040 but i think that there really is something coming along after us
ted_01346_1121040_1124960 i think it &apos;s very haughty of us to think that we &apos;re the end product of evolution
ted_01346_1125600_1130450 and i think all of us here are a part of producing whatever that next thing is
ted_01346_1131640_1137660 so lunch is coming along and i think i will stop at that point before i get selected out
ted_01346_1144435_1144635 applause
ted_01353_0013000_0014870 i &apos;m here to share my photography
ted_01353_0016890_0018980 or is it photography
ted_01353_0019250_0023160 because of course this is a photograph that you can &apos;t take with your camera
ted_01353_0024190_0029010 yet my interest in photography started as i got my first digital camera at the age of 15
ted_01353_0030540_0038840 it mixed with my earlier passion for drawing but it was a bit different because using the camera the process was in the planning instead
ted_01353_0039190_0045290 and when you take a photograph with a camera the process ends when you press the trigger
ted_01353_0046220_0051060 so to me it felt like photography was more about being at the right place and the right time
ted_01353_0052130_0053990 i felt like anyone could do that
ted_01353_0054960_0060900 so i wanted to create something different something where the process starts when you press the trigger
ted_01353_0062510_0066650 photos like this construction going on along a busy road
ted_01353_0067280_0069100 but it has an unexpected twist
ted_01353_0069620_0072570 and despite that it retains a level of realism
ted_01353_0072540_0083130 or photos like these both dark and colorful but all with a common goal of retaining the level of realism
ted_01353_0084980_0087570 when i say realism i mean photorealism
ted_01353_0087760_0097400 because of course it &apos;s not something you can capture really but i always want it to look like it could have been captured somehow as a photograph
ted_01353_0098190_0102390 photos where you will need a brief moment to think to figure out the trick
ted_01353_0103470_0107170 so it &apos;s more about capturing an idea than about capturing a moment really
ted_01353_0109150_0112360 but what &apos;s the trick that makes it look realistic
ted_01353_0113370_0121190 is it something about the details or the colors is it something about the light what creates the illusion
ted_01353_0123440_0126050 sometimes the perspective is the illusion
ted_01353_0126940_0132270 but in the end it comes down to how we interpret the world and how it can be realized on a twodimensional surface
ted_01353_0133440_0138530 it &apos;s not really what is realistic it &apos;s what we think looks realistic really
ted_01353_0139230_0141700 so i think the basics are quite simple
ted_01353_0142930_0150220 i just see it as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together to create alternate reality
ted_01353_0151680_0153020 and let me show you a simple example
ted_01353_0154870_0161320 here we have three perfectly imaginable physical objects something we all can relate to living in a threedimensional world
ted_01353_0162260_0169590 but combined in a certain way they can create something that still looks threedimensional like it could exist
ted_01353_0170940_0173100 but at the same time we know it can &apos;t
ted_01353_0173750_0178770 so we trick our brains because our brain simply doesn &apos;t accept the fact that it doesn &apos;t really make sense
ted_01353_0179850_0184160 and i see the same process with combining photographs
ted_01353_0184980_0187690 it &apos;s just really about combining different realities
ted_01353_0189280_0199130 so the things that make a photograph look realistic i think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t even think about the things all around us in our daily lives
ted_01353_0200600_0207120 but when combining photographs this is really important to consider because otherwise it just looks wrong somehow
ted_01353_0208600_0213240 so i would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow to achieve a realistic result
ted_01353_0215240_0217180 as you can see these images aren &apos;t really special
ted_01353_0217750_0220930 but combined they can create something like this
ted_01353_0224110_0227770 so the first rule is that photos combined should have the same perspective
ted_01353_0229070_0232880 secondly photos combined should have the same type of light
ted_01353_0233960_0239380 and these two images both fulfill these two requirements shot at the same height and in the same type of light
ted_01353_0240820_0248200 the third one is about making it impossible to distinguish where the different images begin and end by making it seamless
ted_01353_0249360_0252510 make it impossible to say how the image actually was composed
ted_01353_0253910_0275720 so by matching color contrast and brightness in the borders between the different images adding photographic defects like depth of field desaturated colors and noise we erase the borders between the different images and make it look like one single image despite the fact that one image can contain hundreds of layers basically
ted_01353_0277180_0287220 so here &apos;s another example laughter one might think that this is just an image of a landscape and the lower part is what &apos;s manipulated
ted_01353_0288260_0293210 but this image is actually entirely composed of photographs from different locations
ted_01353_0294400_0302400 i personally think that it &apos;s easier to actually create a place than to find a place because then you don &apos;t need to compromise with the ideas in your head
ted_01353_0303450_0305970 but it does require a lot of planning
ted_01353_0307180_0314150 and getting this idea during winter i knew that i had several months to plan it to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle basically
ted_01353_0315460_0318620 so for example the fish was captured on a fishing trip
ted_01353_0320200_0322100 the shores are from a different location
ted_01353_0322160_0324290 the underwater part was captured in a stone pit
ted_01353_0325120_0329730 and yeah i even turned the house on top of the island red to make it look more swedish
ted_01353_0331060_0335110 so to achieve a realistic result i think it comes down to planning
ted_01353_0336360_0338850 it always starts with a sketch an idea
ted_01353_0340380_0342830 then it &apos;s about combining the different photographs
ted_01353_0343970_0346540 and here every piece is very well planned
ted_01353_0346790_0353510 and if you do a good job capturing the photos the result can be quite beautiful and also quite realistic
ted_01353_0355290_0364350 so all the tools are out there and the only thing that limits us is our imagination
ted_01353_0367230_0367550 thank you
ted_01353_0370905_0371105 applause
ted_01359_0012350_0016110 i would like to talk to you about why many ehealth projects fail
ted_01359_0016900_0021800 and i really think that the most important thing of it is that we stopped listening to patients
ted_01359_0022590_0026550 and one thing we did at radboud university is we appointed a chief listening officer
ted_01359_0026670_0035220 not in a very scientific way she puts up a little cup of coffee or a cup of tea and asks patients family relatives what &apos;s up
ted_01359_0035560_0045950 how could we help you and we think we like to think that this is one of the major problems why all maybe not all but most of the ehealth projects fail since we stopped listening
ted_01359_0047220_0049840 this is my weight scale it &apos;s a very simple thing
ted_01359_0049840_0051880 it &apos;s got one knob on off
ted_01359_0052050_0054030 and every morning i hop on it
ted_01359_0054870_0057620 and yes i &apos;ve got a challenge as you might see
ted_01359_0058610_0061260 and i put my challenge on 95 kg
ted_01359_0061620_0068190 but the thing is that it &apos;s made this simple that whenever i hop on it sends my data to google health as well
ted_01359_0069310_0088580 and it &apos;s collected by my general practitioner as well so he can see what &apos;s my problem in weight not on the very moment that i need cardiologic support or something like it but also looking backward but there &apos;s another thing as some of you might know i &apos;ve got more than 4000 followers on twitter
ted_01359_0088630_0096850 so every morning i hop on my weight scale and before i &apos;m in my car people start talking to me i think you need a light lunch today lucien
ted_01359_0097485_0097685 laughter
ted_01359_0098540_0110300 but that &apos;s the nicest thing that could happen since this is peer pressure peer pressure used to help patients since this could be used for obesity it could be used to stop patients from smoking
ted_01359_0110340_0122020 but on the other hand it also could be used to get people out of their chairs and try to work together in some kind of gaming activity to get more control of their health
ted_01359_0122660_0129930 as of next week it will soon be available there will be this little bloodpressure meter connected to an iphone or something or other
ted_01359_0130610_0140890 and people will be able from their homes to take their blood pressure send it to their doctor and eventually share it with others for instance for over a 100 dollars
ted_01359_0141280_0163410 and this is the point where patients get into position and can collect not only their own control again be captain of their own ship but also can help us in health care due to the challenges that we face like healthcare cost explosion doubled demand and things like that make techniques that are easy to use and start with this to embrace patients in the team
ted_01359_0163860_0167390 and you can do this with techniques like this but also by crowdsourcing
ted_01359_0168090_0172570 and one of the things we did that i would like to share with you introduced by a little video
ted_01359_0245220_0247510 we &apos;ve all got navigation controls in our car
ted_01359_0247720_0249440 we maybe even have it in our cellphone
ted_01359_0250380_0254190 we perfectly know where all the atms are just about the city of maastricht
ted_01359_0254780_0256860 the other thing is we know where all the gas stations are
ted_01359_0257790_0259990 and sure we could find fast food chains
ted_01359_0260850_0264740 but where would be the nearest aed to help this patient
ted_01359_0265040_0266640 we asked around and nobody knew
ted_01359_0267640_0271930 nobody knew where the nearest lifesaving aed was to be obtained right now
ted_01359_0272670_0274850 so what we did we crowdsourced the netherlands
ted_01359_0275200_0285400 we set up a website and asked the crowd if you see an aed please submit it tell us where it is tell us when it &apos;s open since sometimes in office hours it &apos;s closed of course
ted_01359_0285970_0288830 and over 10000 aeds in the netherlands already have been submitted
ted_01359_0288830_0292370 the next step we took was to find the applications for it
ted_01359_0292610_0294100 and we built an ipad application
ted_01359_0294630_0298760 we made an application for layar augmented reality to find these aeds
ted_01359_0299440_0310750 and whenever you are in a city like maastricht and somebody collapses you can use your iphone and within the next weeks also your microsoft cellphone to find the nearest aed which can save lives
ted_01359_0311400_0318310 and as of today we would like to introduce this not only as aed4eu which is what the product is called but also aed4us
ted_01359_0318980_0321040 and we would like to start this on a worldwide level
ted_01359_0321500_0340160 and ask all of our colleagues in the rest of the world colleague universities to help us to find and work and act like a hub to crowdsource all these aeds all around the world that whenever you &apos;re on holiday and somebody collapses might it be your own relative or someone just in front of you you can find this
ted_01359_0340660_0347170 the other thing we would like to ask is of companies also all over the world that will be able to help us validate these aeds
ted_01359_0347570_0354450 these might be courier services or cable guys for instance just to see whether the aed that is submitted is still in place
ted_01359_0355100_0360810 so please help us on this one and try to make not only health a little bit better but take control of it
ted_01359_0361170_0361520 thank you
ted_01359_0366115_0366315 applause
ted_01366_0012900_0017360 my story begins right here actually in rajasthan about two years ago
ted_01366_0017950_0022500 i was in the desert under the starry skies with the sufi singer mukhtiar ali
ted_01366_0022870_0028900 and we were in conversation about how nothing had changed since the time of the ancient indian epic the mahabharata
ted_01366_0029810_0035410 so back in the day when us indians wanted to travel we &apos;d jump into a chariot and we &apos;d zoom across the sky
ted_01366_0036060_0038130 now we do the same with airplanes
ted_01366_0038890_0047060 back then when arjuna the great indian warrior prince when he was thirsty he &apos;d take out a bow he &apos;d shoot it into the ground and water would come out
ted_01366_0047560_0050790 now we do the same with drills and machines
ted_01366_0051700_0056680 the conclusion that we came to was that magic had been replaced by machinery
ted_01366_0057530_0059490 and this made me really sad
ted_01366_0060220_0063200 i found myself becoming a little bit of a technophobe
ted_01366_0063200_0072280 i was terrified by this idea that i would lose the ability to enjoy and appreciate the sunset without having my camera on me without tweeting it to my friends
ted_01366_0072730_0077250 and it felt like technology should enable magic not kill it
ted_01366_0077250_0081600 when i was a little girl my grandfather gave me his little silver pocket watch
ted_01366_0081850_0086760 and this piece of 50yearold technology became the most magical thing to me
ted_01366_0086940_0093210 it became a gilded gateway into a world full of pirates and shipwrecks and images in my imagination
ted_01366_0094100_0100080 so i felt like our cellphones and our fancy watches and our cameras had stopped us from dreaming
ted_01366_0100080_0102330 they stopped us from being inspired
ted_01366_0102550_0108950 and so i jumped in i jumped into this world of technology to see how i could use it to enable magic as opposed to kill it
ted_01366_0109680_0112020 i &apos;ve been illustrating books since i was 16
ted_01366_0112210_0118190 and so when i saw the ipad i saw it as a storytelling device that could connect readers all over the world
ted_01366_0118210_0121790 it can know how we &apos;re holding it
ted_01366_0121790_0123790 it can know where we are
ted_01366_0124190_0128610 it brings together image and text and animation and sound and touch
ted_01366_0129010_0132400 storytelling is becoming more and more multisensorial
ted_01366_0132600_0133720 but what are we doing with it
ted_01366_0133990_0140100 so i &apos;m actually just going to go in and launch khoya an interactive app for the ipad
ted_01366_0141890_0177940 so it says place your fingers upon each light and so music it says this box belongs to and so i type in my name
ted_01366_0179120_0180850 and actually i become a character in the book
ted_01366_0181080_0187990 at various points a little letter drops down to me and the ipad knows where you live because of gps which is actually addressed to me
ted_01366_0188230_0191330 the child in me is really excited by these kinds of possibilities
ted_01366_0192920_0195210 now i &apos;ve been talking a lot about magic
ted_01366_0195360_0202650 and i don &apos;t mean wizards and dragons i mean the kind of childhood magic those ideas that we all harbored as children
ted_01366_0203340_0207460 this idea of fireflies in a jar for some reason was always really exciting to me
ted_01366_0207750_0211820 and so over here you need to tilt your ipad take the fireflies out
ted_01366_0212340_0214290 and they actually illuminate your way through the rest of the book
ted_01366_0218950_0225640 another idea that really fascinated me as a child was that an entire galaxy could be contained within a single marble
ted_01366_0226250_0235570 and so over here each book and each world becomes a little marble that i drag in to this magical device within the device
ted_01366_0237100_0240630 and it opens up a map
ted_01366_0242450_0246490 all along all fantasy books have always had maps but these maps have been static
ted_01366_0246500_0250990 this is a map that grows and glows and becomes your navigation for the rest of the book
ted_01366_0251240_0253890 it reveals itself to you at certain points in the book as well
ted_01366_0254620_0256580 so i &apos;m just going to enter in
ted_01366_0259100_0266270 another thing that &apos;s actually really important to me is creating content that is indian and yet very contemporary
ted_01366_0266890_0268640 over here these are the apsaras
ted_01366_0268820_0277020 so we &apos;ve all heard about fairies and we &apos;ve all heard about nymphs but how many people outside of india know about their indian counterparts the apsaras
ted_01366_0277290_0283460 these poor apsaras have been trapped inside indra &apos;s chambers for thousands of years in an old and musty book
ted_01366_0284140_0287320 and so we &apos;re bringing them back in a contemporary story for children
ted_01366_0287370_0300140 and a story that actually deals with new issues like the environmental crisis music
ted_01366_0326710_0333680 speaking of the environmental crisis i think a big problem has been in the last 10 years is that children have been locked inside their rooms glued to their pcs they haven &apos;t been able to get out
ted_01366_0333960_0339830 but now with mobile technology we can actually take our children outside into the natural world with their technology
ted_01366_0340250_0350530 one of the interactions in the book is that you &apos;re sent off on this quest where you need to go outside take out your camera on the ipad and collect pictures of different natural objects
ted_01366_0350880_0355780 when i was a child i had multiple collections of sticks and stones and pebbles and shells
ted_01366_0356040_0357790 and somehow kids don &apos;t do that anymore
ted_01366_0357970_0365000 so in bringing back this childhood ritual you need to go out and in one chapter take a picture of a flower and then tag it
ted_01366_0366240_0369850 in another chapter you need to take a picture of a piece of bark and then tag that
ted_01366_0370110_0375260 and what happens is that you actually create a digital collection of photographs that you can then put up online
ted_01366_0375560_0387030 a child in london puts up a picture of a fox and says oh i saw a fox today a child in india says i saw a monkey today and it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photographs that you &apos;ve actually taken
ted_01366_0387400_0395210 in the possibilities of linking together magic the earth and technology there are multiple possibilities
ted_01366_0395350_0406710 in the next book we plan on having an interaction where you take your ipad out with the video on and through augmented reality you see this layer of animated pixies appear on a houseplant that &apos;s outside your house
ted_01366_0407540_0410010 at one point your screen is filled up with leaves
ted_01366_0410010_0415260 and so you need to make the sound of wind and blow them away and read the rest of the book
ted_01366_0416450_0425780 we &apos;re moving we &apos;re all moving here to a world where the forces of nature come closer together to technology and magic and technology can come closer together
ted_01366_0426000_0429030 we &apos;re harnessing energy from the sun
ted_01366_0429030_0439410 we &apos;re bringing our children and ourselves closer to the natural world and that magic and joy and childhood love that we had through the simple medium of a story
ted_01366_0439800_0440240 thank you
ted_01366_0451235_0451435 applause
ted_01368_0012670_0045430 how can i speak in 10 minutes about the bonds of women over three generations about how the astonishing strength of those bonds took hold in the life of a fouryearold girl huddled with her young sister her mother and her grandmother for five days and nights in a small boat in the china sea more than 30 years ago bonds that took hold in the life of that small girl and never let go that small girl now living in san francisco and speaking to you today
ted_01368_0047060_0048570 this is not a finished story
ted_01368_0049490_0051890 it is a jigsaw puzzle still being put together
ted_01368_0053230_0055000 let me tell you about some of the pieces
ted_01368_0056920_0060770 imagine the first piece a man burning his life &apos;s work
ted_01368_0061660_0070310 he is a poet a playwright a man whose whole life had been balanced on the single hope of his country &apos;s unity and freedom
ted_01368_0071250_0077420 imagine him as the communists enter saigon confronting the fact that his life had been a complete waste
ted_01368_0078450_0080960 words for so long his friends now mocked him
ted_01368_0082230_0083670 he retreated into silence
ted_01368_0084710_0086730 he died broken by history
ted_01368_0088410_0089910 he is my grandfather
ted_01368_0091080_0092570 i never knew him in real life
ted_01368_0094980_0097170 but our lives are much more than our memories
ted_01368_0098400_0100830 my grandmother never let me forget his life
ted_01368_0101660_0110150 my duty was not to allow it to have been in vain and my lesson was to learn that yes history tried to crush us but we endured
ted_01368_0111990_0117410 the next piece of the jigsaw is of a boat in the early dawn slipping silently out to sea
ted_01368_0118830_0126390 my mother mai was 18 when her father died already in an arranged marriage already with two small girls
ted_01368_0127480_0134130 for her life had distilled itself into one task the escape of her family and a new life in australia
ted_01368_0135510_0138190 it was inconceivable to her that she would not succeed
ted_01368_0139680_0145720 so after a fouryear saga that defies fiction a boat slipped out to sea disguised as a fishing vessel
ted_01368_0147400_0149050 all the adults knew the risks
ted_01368_0150360_0153500 the greatest fear was of pirates rape and death
ted_01368_0155000_0159090 like most adults on the boat my mother carried a small bottle of poison
ted_01368_0160460_0165630 if we were captured first my sister and i then she and my grandmother would drink
ted_01368_0167450_0176660 my first memories are from the boat the steady beat of the engine the bow dipping into each wave the vast and empty horizon
ted_01368_0178020_0187800 i don &apos;t remember the pirates who came many times but were bluffed by the bravado of the men on our boat or the engine dying and failing to start for six hours
ted_01368_0189230_0203520 but i do remember the lights on the oil rig off the malaysian coast and the young man who collapsed and died the journey &apos;s end too much for him and the first apple i tasted given to me by the men on the rig
ted_01368_0204580_0206860 no apple has ever tasted the same
ted_01368_0210180_0213690 after three months in a refugee camp we landed in melbourne
ted_01368_0214230_0220090 and the next piece of the jigsaw is about four women across three generations shaping a new life together
ted_01368_0222090_0227810 we settled in footscray a workingclass suburb whose demographic is layers of immigrants
ted_01368_0228490_0234980 unlike the settled middleclass suburbs whose existence i was oblivious of there was no sense of entitlement in footscray
ted_01368_0235910_0238620 the smells from shop doors were from the rest of the world
ted_01368_0239090_0245510 and the snippets of halting english were exchanged between people who had one thing in common they were starting again
ted_01368_0247440_0253050 my mother worked on farms then on a car assembly line working six days double shifts
ted_01368_0254160_0273560 somehow she found time to study english and gain it qualifications we were poor all the dollars were allocated and extra tuition in english and mathematics was budgeted for regardless of what missed out which was usually new clothes they were always secondhand
ted_01368_0274330_0278050 two pairs of stockings for school each to hide the holes in the other
ted_01368_0278960_0282980 a school uniform down to the ankles because it had to last for six years
ted_01368_0284780_0293780 and there were rare but searing chants of sliteye and the occasional graffiti asian go home go home to where
ted_01368_0294980_0296600 something stiffened inside me
ted_01368_0297380_0301800 there was a gathering of resolve and a quiet voice saying i will bypass you
ted_01368_0303970_0307310 my mother my sister and i slept in the same bed
ted_01368_0308630_0315790 my mother was exhausted each night but we told one another about our day and listened to the movements of my grandmother around the house
ted_01368_0317160_0319890 my mother suffered from nightmares all about the boat
ted_01368_0321470_0325170 and my job was to stay awake until her nightmares came so i could wake her
ted_01368_0328040_0332610 she opened a computer store then studied to be a beautician and opened another business
ted_01368_0333470_0342000 and the women came with their stories about men who could not make the transition angry and inflexible and troubled children caught between two worlds
ted_01368_0343130_0349480 grants and sponsors were sought centers were established i lived in parallel worlds
ted_01368_0350040_0355450 in one i was the classic asian student relentless in the demands that i made on myself
ted_01368_0356550_0363150 in the other i was enmeshed in lives that were precarious tragically scarred by violence drug abuse and isolation
ted_01368_0364680_0366530 but so many over the years were helped
ted_01368_0366760_0371980 and for that work when i was a finalyear law student i was chosen as the young australian of the year
ted_01368_0372290_0377750 and i was catapulted from one piece of the jigsaw to another and their edges didn &apos;t fit
ted_01368_0378840_0391290 tan le anonymous footscray resident was now tan le refugee and social activist invited to speak in venues she had never heard of and into homes whose existence she could never have imagined
ted_01368_0392310_0393710 i didn &apos;t know the protocols
ted_01368_0394380_0396010 i didn &apos;t know how to use the cutlery
ted_01368_0397130_0399120 i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine
ted_01368_0399860_0401920 i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything
ted_01368_0403430_0421760 i wanted to retreat to the routines and comfort of life in an unsung suburb a grandmother a mother and two daughters ending each day as they had for almost 20 years telling one another the story of their day and falling asleep the three of us still in the same bed
ted_01368_0424160_0425910 i told my mother i couldn &apos;t do it
ted_01368_0427730_0439360 she reminded me that i was now the same age she had been when we boarded the boat no had never been an option just do it she said and don &apos;t be what you &apos;re not
ted_01368_0441160_0447270 so i spoke out on youth unemployment and education and the neglect of the marginalized and disenfranchised
ted_01368_0447870_0451190 and the more candidly i spoke the more i was asked to speak
ted_01368_0453270_0459840 i met people from all walks of life so many of them doing the thing they loved living on the frontiers of possibility
ted_01368_0460560_0465940 and even though i finished my degree i realized i could not settle into a career in law
ted_01368_0466660_0468600 there had to be another piece of the jigsaw
ted_01368_0469910_0484300 and i realized at the same time that it is ok to be an outsider a recent arrival new on the scene and not just ok but something to be thankful for perhaps a gift from the boat
ted_01368_0485270_0493420 because being an insider can so easily mean collapsing the horizons can so easily mean accepting the presumptions of your province
ted_01368_0494950_0501640 i have stepped outside my comfort zone enough now to know that yes the world does fall apart but not in the way that you fear
ted_01368_0502530_0506450 possibilities that would not have been allowed were outrageously encouraged
ted_01368_0507000_0513050 there was an energy there an implacable optimism a strange mixture of humility and daring
ted_01368_0514310_0515560 so i followed my hunches
ted_01368_0516050_0522180 i gathered around me a small team of people for whom the label it can &apos;t be done was an irresistible challenge
ted_01368_0523360_0524780 for a year we were penniless
ted_01368_0525390_0528830 at the end of each day i made a huge pot of soup which we all shared
ted_01368_0529920_0531440 we worked well into each night
ted_01368_0532320_0537380 most of our ideas were crazy but a few were brilliant and we broke through
ted_01368_0539530_0549450 i made the decision to move to the us after only one trip my hunches again three months later i had relocated and the adventure has continued
ted_01368_0551640_0554590 before i close though let me tell you about my grandmother
ted_01368_0556050_0561930 she grew up at a time when confucianism was the social norm and the local mandarin was the person who mattered
ted_01368_0562950_0564790 life hadn &apos;t changed for centuries
ted_01368_0566080_0568590 her father died soon after she was born
ted_01368_0569700_0571080 her mother raised her alone
ted_01368_0572680_0577310 at 17 she became the second wife of a mandarin whose mother beat her
ted_01368_0578740_0596950 with no support from her husband she caused a sensation by taking him to court and prosecuting her own case and a far greater sensation when she won laughter applause it can &apos;t be done was shown to be wrong
ted_01368_0600620_0607620 i was taking a shower in a hotel room in sydney the moment she died 600 miles away in melbourne
ted_01368_0609090_0612380 i looked through the shower screen and saw her standing on the other side
ted_01368_0613230_0614920 i knew she had come to say goodbye
ted_01368_0615940_0617540 my mother phoned minutes later
ted_01368_0619320_0623880 a few days later we went to a buddhist temple in footscray and sat around her casket
ted_01368_0624930_0628300 we told her stories and assured her that we were still with her
ted_01368_0629710_0634250 at midnight the monk came and told us he had to close the casket
ted_01368_0635410_0637620 my mother asked us to feel her hand
ted_01368_0638540_0650850 she asked the monk why is it that her hand is so warm and the rest of her is so cold because you have been holding it since this morning he said you have not let it go
ted_01368_0654230_0657930 if there is a sinew in our family it runs through the women
ted_01368_0659050_0666410 given who we were and how life had shaped us we can now see that the men that might have come into our lives would have thwarted us
ted_01368_0667360_0669130 defeat would have come too easily
ted_01368_0670600_0674290 now i would like to have my own children and i wonder about the boat
ted_01368_0675800_0677550 who could ever wish it on their own
ted_01368_0678960_0683300 yet i am afraid of privilege of ease of entitlement
ted_01368_0684410_0695440 can i give them a bow in their lives dipping bravely into each wave the unperturbed and steady beat of the engine the vast horizon that guarantees nothing
ted_01368_0697430_0698120 i don &apos;t know
ted_01368_0699200_0712140 but if i could give it and still see them safely through i would
ted_01368_0712100_0712300 applause
ted_01368_0714520_0722620 trevor neilson and also tan &apos;s mother is here today in the fourth or fifth row
ted_01371_0012490_0024480 hi i &apos;m kevin allocca i &apos;m the trends manager at youtube and i professionally watch youtube videos it &apos;s true so we &apos;re going to talk a little bit today about how videos go viral and then why that even matters
ted_01371_0025050_0032630 we all want to be stars celebrities singers comedians and when i was younger that seemed so very very hard to do
ted_01371_0033060_0039970 but now web video has made it so that any of us or any of the creative things that we do can become completely famous in a part of our world &apos;s culture
ted_01371_0041030_0043930 any one of you could be famous on the internet by next saturday
ted_01371_0044220_0047970 but there are over 48 hours of video uploaded to youtube every minute
ted_01371_0048780_0053930 and of that only a tiny percentage ever goes viral and gets tons of views and becomes a cultural moment
ted_01371_0053930_0055330 so how does it happen
ted_01371_0056260_0062300 three things tastemakers communities of participation and unexpectedness all right let &apos;s go
ted_01371_0067980_0077330 video bear vasquez oh my god oh my god oh my god wooo ohhhhh wowwww
ted_01371_0077600_0082400 ka last year bear vasquez posted this video that he had shot outside his home in yosemite national park
ted_01371_0082700_0091080 in 2010 it was viewed 23 million times laughter this is a chart of what it looked like when it first became popular last summer
ted_01371_0092220_0095060 but he didn &apos;t actually set out to make a viral video bear
ted_01371_0095090_0096900 he just wanted to share a rainbow
ted_01371_0097220_0104810 because that &apos;s what you do when your name is yosemite mountain bear laughter and he had posted lots of nature videos in fact
ted_01371_0104810_0108000 and this video had actually been posted all the way back in january
ted_01371_0108920_0118680 so what happened here jimmy kimmel actually jimmy kimmel posted this tweet that would eventually propel the video to be as popular as it would become
ted_01371_0119010_0124330 because tastemakers like jimmy kimmel introduce us to new and interesting things and bring them to a larger audience
ted_01371_0126590_0127030 video rebecca black ♫ it &apos;s friday friday
ted_01371_0128550_0129880 gotta get down on friday
ted_01371_0130110_0133390 ♫ ♫ everybody &apos;s looking forward to the weekend weekend
ted_01371_0135160_0135700 ♫ ♫ friday friday
ted_01371_0135780_0136390 gettin &apos; down on friday ♫
ted_01371_0136560_0146610 ka so you didn &apos;t think that we could actually have this conversation without talking about this video i hope rebecca black &apos;s friday is one of the most popular videos of the year
ted_01371_0146650_0149450 it &apos;s been seen nearly 200 million times this year
ted_01371_0150550_0151920 this is a chart of what it looked like
ted_01371_0151930_0156260 and similar to double rainbow it seems to have just sprouted up out of nowhere
ted_01371_0157240_0159070 so what happened on this day
ted_01371_0159730_0161770 well it was a friday this is true
ted_01371_0162440_0173280 and if you &apos;re wondering about those other spikes those are also fridays laughter but what about this day this one particular friday
ted_01371_0174330_0177460 well tosh0 picked it up a lot of blogs starting writing about
ted_01371_0177540_0182690 michael j nelson from mystery science theater was one of the first people to post a joke about the video on twitter
ted_01371_0183000_0190330 but what &apos;s important is that an individual or a group of tastemakers took a point of view and they shared that with a larger audience accelerating the process
ted_01371_0190730_0197150 and so then this community formed of people who shared this big inside joke and they started talking about it and doing things with it
ted_01371_0197470_0200230 and now there are 10000 parodies of friday on youtube
ted_01371_0200720_0219080 even in the first seven days there was one parody for every other day of the week laughter unlike the oneway entertainment of the 20th century this community participation is how we become a part of the phenomenon either by spreading it or by doing something new with it
ted_01371_0223195_0223395 music
ted_01371_0228770_0232970 so nyan cat is a looped animation with looped music
ted_01371_0233440_0235280 it &apos;s this just like this
ted_01371_0235380_0239210 it &apos;s been viewed nearly 50 million times this year
ted_01371_0239670_0257740 and if you think that that is weird you should know that there is a threehour version of this that &apos;s been viewed four million times laughter even cats were watching this video laughter cats were watching other cats watch this video
ted_01371_0266995_0267195 laughter
ted_01371_0267120_0274810 but what &apos;s important here is the creativity that it inspired amongst this techie geeky internet culture
ted_01371_0274810_0312010 there were remixes laughter someone made an old timey version laughter and then it went international laughter an entire remix community sprouted up that brought it from being just a stupid joke to something that we can all actually be a part of because we don &apos;t just enjoy now we participate
ted_01371_0315830_0317540 and who could have predicted any of this
ted_01371_0317540_0325830 who could have predicted double rainbow or rebecca black or nyan cat what scripts could you have written that would have contained this in it
ted_01371_0326890_0334710 in a world where over two days of video get uploaded every minute only that which is truly unique and unexpected can stand out in the way that these things have
ted_01371_0335130_0343030 when a friend of mine told me that i needed to see this great video about a guy protesting bicycle fines in new york city i admit i wasn &apos;t very interested
ted_01371_0343290_0356020 video casey niestat so i got a ticket for not riding in the bike lane but often there are obstructions that keep you from properly riding in the bike lane
ted_01371_0356020_0356340 laughter
ted_01371_0361830_0373320 ka by being totally surprising and humorous casey niestat got his funny idea and point seen five million times
ted_01371_0373920_0377180 and so this approach holds for anything new that we do creatively
ted_01371_0377760_0380910 and so it all brings us to one big question
ted_01371_0382620_0390850 video bear vasquez what does this mean
ted_01371_0392460_0392740 ohhhh laughter
ted_01371_0392750_0393430 ka what does it mean
ted_01371_0393600_0404600 tastemakers creative participating communities complete unexpectedness these are characteristics of a new kind of media and a new kind of culture where anyone has access and the audience defines the popularity
ted_01371_0405060_0410020 i mean as mentioned earlier one of the biggest stars in the world right now justin bieber got his start on youtube
ted_01371_0410880_0412940 no one has to greenlight your idea
ted_01371_0413450_0416590 and we all now feel some ownership in our own pop culture
ted_01371_0417160_0424790 and these are not characteristics of old media and they &apos;re barely true of the media of today but they will define the entertainment of the future
ted_01371_0425250_0425500 thank you
ted_01371_0425425_0425625 applause
ted_01375_0004825_0005025 applause
ted_01375_0004950_0018630 video announcer threats in the wake of bin laden &apos;s death have spiked
ted_01375_0018630_0019820 announcer two famine in somalia
ted_01375_0019950_0021090 announcer three police pepper spray
ted_01375_0021090_0022250 announcer four vicious cartels
ted_01375_0022250_0023390 announcer five caustic cruise lines
ted_01375_0023390_0024500 announcer six societal decay
ted_01375_0024500_0025450 announcer seven 65 dead
ted_01375_0025435_0025635 announcer eight tsunami warning
ted_01375_0025620_0026750 announcer nine cyberattacks
ted_01375_0026790_0034770 multiple announcers drug war mass destruction tornado recession default doomsday egypt syria crisis death disaster oh my god
ted_01375_0034770_0044020 peter diamandis so those are just a few of the clips i collected over the last six months could have easily been the last six days or the last six years
ted_01375_0044580_0051870 the point is that the news media preferentially feeds us negative stories because that &apos;s what our minds pay attention to
ted_01375_0053460_0054800 and there &apos;s a very good reason for that
ted_01375_0055000_0061110 every second of every day our senses bring in way too much data than we can possibly process in our brains
ted_01375_0061810_0070850 and because nothing is more important to us than survival the first stop of all of that data is an ancient sliver of the temporal lobe called the amygdala
ted_01375_0072020_0076290 now the amygdala is our early warning detector our danger detector
ted_01375_0076870_0082010 it sorts and scours through all of the information looking for anything in the environment that might harm us
ted_01375_0082770_0087450 so given a dozen news stories we will preferentially look at the negative news
ted_01375_0088910_0093420 and that old newspaper saying if it bleeds it leads is very true
ted_01375_0095190_0104220 so given all of our digital devices that are bringing all the negative news to us seven days a week 24 hours a day it &apos;s no wonder that we &apos;re pessimistic
ted_01375_0104890_0108150 it &apos;s no wonder that people think that the world is getting worse
ted_01375_0110330_0112580 but perhaps that &apos;s not the case
ted_01375_0113480_0118880 perhaps instead it &apos;s the distortions brought to us of what &apos;s really going on
ted_01375_0120550_0134630 perhaps the tremendous progress we &apos;ve made over the last century by a series of forces are in fact accelerating to a point that we have the potential in the next three decades to create a world of abundance
ted_01375_0135520_0144180 now i &apos;m not saying we don &apos;t have our set of problems climate crisis species extinction water and energy shortage we surely do
ted_01375_0144610_0151390 and as humans we are far better at seeing the problems way in advance but ultimately we knock them down
ted_01375_0153680_0159290 so let &apos;s look at what this last century has been to see where we &apos;re going
ted_01375_0160120_0168980 over the last hundred years the average human lifespan has more than doubled average per capita income adjusted for inflation around the world has tripled
ted_01375_0169580_0172580 childhood mortality has come down a factor of 10
ted_01375_0174300_0179570 add to that the cost of food electricity transportation communication have dropped 10 to 1000fold
ted_01375_0179620_0186970 steve pinker has showed us that in fact we &apos;re living during the most peaceful time ever in human history
ted_01375_0188650_0195450 and charles kenny that global literacy has gone from 25 percent to over 80 percent in the last 130 years
ted_01375_0196530_0199100 we truly are living in an extraordinary time
ted_01375_0200530_0201950 and many people forget this
ted_01375_0202490_0205330 and we keep setting our expectations higher and higher
ted_01375_0205550_0207940 in fact we redefine what poverty means
ted_01375_0208620_0219750 think of this in america today the majority of people under the poverty line still have electricity water toilets refrigerators television mobile phones air conditioning and cars
ted_01375_0221270_0227160 the wealthiest robber barons of the last century the emperors on this planet could have never dreamed of such luxuries
ted_01375_0231290_0238060 underpinning much of this is technology and of late exponentially growing technologies
ted_01375_0239460_0251760 my good friend ray kurzweil showed that any tool that becomes an information technology jumps on this curve on moore &apos;s law and experiences price performance doubling every 12 to 24 months
ted_01375_0252650_0262760 that &apos;s why the cellphone in your pocket is literally a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer of the &apos; 70s now look at this curve this is moore &apos;s law over the last hundred years
ted_01375_0262760_0264630 i want you to notice two things from this curve
ted_01375_0264800_0273120 number one how smooth it is through good time and bad time war time and peace time recession depression and boom time
ted_01375_0275210_0278810 this is the result of faster computers being used to build faster computers
ted_01375_0280470_0283110 it doesn &apos;t slow for any of our grand challenges
ted_01375_0284110_0288780 and also even though it &apos;s plotted on a log curve on the left it &apos;s curving upwards
ted_01375_0289220_0292850 the rate at which the technology is getting faster is itself getting faster
ted_01375_0294590_0302690 and on this curve riding on moore &apos;s law are a set of extraordinarily powerful technologies available to all of us
ted_01375_0303210_0327280 cloud computing what my friends at autodesk call infinite computing sensors and networks robotics 3d printing which is the ability to democratize and distribute personalized production around the planet synthetic biology fuels vaccines and foods digital medicine nanomaterials and ai i mean how many of you saw the winning of jeopardy by ibm &apos;s watson
ted_01375_0327820_0334810 i mean that was epic in fact i scoured the headlines looking for the best headline in a newspaper i could
ted_01375_0334810_0340840 and i love this watson vanquishes human opponents jeopardy &apos;s not an easy game
ted_01375_0341410_0343570 it &apos;s about the nuance of human language
ted_01375_0344090_0349540 and imagine if you would ai &apos; s like this on the cloud available to every person with a cellphone
ted_01375_0352060_0357410 four years ago here at ted ray kurzweil and i started a new university called singularity university
ted_01375_0358010_0364780 and we teach our students all of these technologies and particularly how they can be used to solve humanity &apos;s grand challenges
ted_01375_0366120_0374630 and every year we ask them to start a company or a product or a service that can affect positively the lives of a billion people within a decade
ted_01375_0375830_0381620 think about that the fact that literally a group of students can touch the lives of a billion people today
ted_01375_0382200_0383930 30 years ago that would have sounded ludicrous
ted_01375_0384120_0390140 today we can point at dozens of companies that have done just that
ted_01375_0390140_0399730 when i think about creating abundance it &apos;s not about creating a life of luxury for everybody on this planet it &apos;s about creating a life of possibility
ted_01375_0401030_0405410 it is about taking that which was scarce and making it abundant
ted_01375_0405890_0413430 you see scarcity is contextual and technology is a resourceliberating force
ted_01375_0414370_0415330 let me give you an example
ted_01375_0416720_0420960 so this is a story of napoleon iii in the mid1800s
ted_01375_0420970_0422070 he &apos;s the dude on the left
ted_01375_0423690_0426360 he invited over to dinner the king of siam
ted_01375_0428640_0434770 all of napoleon &apos;s troops were fed with silver utensils napoleon himself with gold utensils
ted_01375_0434770_0438630 but the king of siam he was fed with aluminum utensils
ted_01375_0439120_0445810 you see aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet worth more than gold and platinum
ted_01375_0446710_0450720 it &apos;s the reason that the tip of the washington monument is made of aluminum
ted_01375_0451570_0458080 you see even though aluminum is 83 percent of the earth by mass it doesn &apos;t come as a pure metal
ted_01375_0458420_0460470 it &apos;s all bound by oxygen and silicates
ted_01375_0461910_0469700 but then the technology of electrolysis came along and literally made aluminum so cheap that we use it with throwaway mentality
ted_01375_0470730_0472740 so let &apos;s project this analogy going forward
ted_01375_0474500_0476290 we think about energy scarcity
ted_01375_0477460_0484860 ladies and gentlemen we are on a planet that is bathed with 5000 times more energy than we use in a year
ted_01375_0484860_0490200 16 terawatts of energy hits the earth &apos;s surface every 88 minutes
ted_01375_0490330_0494480 it &apos;s not about being scarce it &apos;s about accessibility
ted_01375_0496460_0497640 and there &apos;s good news here
ted_01375_0498660_0509980 for the first time this year the cost of solargenerated electricity is 50 percent that of dieselgenerated electricity in india 88 rupees versus 17 rupees
ted_01375_0510270_0512620 the cost of solar dropped 50 percent last year
ted_01375_0512900_0524150 last month mit put out a study showing that by the end of this decade in the sunny parts of the united states solar electricity will be six cents a kilowatt hour compared to 15 cents as a national average
ted_01375_0525230_0529750 and if we have abundant energy we also have abundant water
ted_01375_0530840_0534100 now we talk about water wars
ted_01375_0535830_0543430 do you remember when carl sagan turned the voyager spacecraft back towards the earth in 1990 after it just passed saturn
ted_01375_0543670_0544750 he took a famous photo
ted_01375_0544750_0551210 what was it called a pale blue dot because we live on a water planet
ted_01375_0551900_0554700 we live on a planet 70 percent covered by water
ted_01375_0554950_0563570 yes 975 percent is saltwater two percent is ice and we fight over a half a percent of the water on this planet but here too there is hope
ted_01375_0564280_0569520 and there is technology coming online not 10 20 years from now right now
ted_01375_0570950_0572950 there &apos;s nanotechnology coming on nanomaterials
ted_01375_0573500_0587810 and the conversation i had with dean kamen this morning one of the great diy innovators i &apos;d like to share with you he gave me permission to do so his technology called slingshot that many of you may have heard of it is the size of a small dorm room refrigerator
ted_01375_0588000_0596990 it &apos;s able to generate a thousand liters of clean drinking water a day out of any source saltwater polluted water latrine at less than two cents a liter
ted_01375_0599680_0606250 the chairman of cocacola has just agreed to do a major test of hundreds of units of this in the developing world
ted_01375_0606410_0615600 and if that pans out which i have every confidence it will cocacola will deploy this globally to 206 countries around the planet
ted_01375_0616610_0621230 this is the kind of innovation empowered by this technology that exists today
ted_01375_0623420_0625140 and we &apos;ve seen this in cellphones
ted_01375_0625140_0632280 my goodness we &apos;re going to hit 70 percent penetration of cellphones in the developing world by the end of 2013
ted_01375_0632290_0639860 think about it that a masai warrior on a cellphone in the middle of kenya has better mobile comm than president reagan did 25 years ago
ted_01375_0642380_0647670 and if they &apos;re on a smartphone on google they &apos;ve got access to more knowledge and information than president clinton did 15 years ago
ted_01375_0648010_0652460 they &apos;re living in a world of information and communication abundance that no one could have ever predicted
ted_01375_0654620_0672660 better than that the things that you and i spent tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars for gps hd video and still images libraries of books and music medical diagnostic technology are now literally dematerializing and demonetizing into your cellphone
ted_01375_0676980_0680220 probably the best part of it is what &apos;s coming down the pike in health
ted_01375_0681570_0688560 last month i had the pleasure of announcing with qualcomm foundation something called the 10 million qualcomm tricorder x prize
ted_01375_0688560_0699510 we &apos;re challenging teams around the world to basically combine these technologies into a mobile device that you can speak to because it &apos;s got ai you can cough on it you can do a finger blood prick
ted_01375_0699970_0704450 and to win it needs to be able to diagnose you better than a team of boardcertified doctors
ted_01375_0706640_0716910 so literally imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors 25 percent of the disease burden and 13 percent of the health care workers
ted_01375_0717830_0725480 when this device sequences an rna or dna virus that it doesn &apos;t recognize it calls the cdc and prevents the pandemic from happening in the first place
ted_01375_0728650_0733480 but here here is the biggest force for bringing about a world of abundance
ted_01375_0733540_0735420 i call it the rising billion
ted_01375_0736700_0739160 so the white lines here are population
ted_01375_0739520_0742290 we just passed the seven billion mark on earth
ted_01375_0742540_0749470 and by the way the biggest protection against a population explosion is making the world educated and healthy
ted_01375_0751630_0756270 in 2010 we had just short of two billion people online connected
ted_01375_0757970_0762680 by 2020 that &apos;s going from two billion to five billion internet users
ted_01375_0763480_0770650 three billion new minds who have never been heard from before are connecting to the global conversation
ted_01375_0771760_0780460 what will these people want what will they consume what will they desire and rather than having economic shutdown we &apos;re about to have the biggest economic injection ever
ted_01375_0780790_0786260 these people represent tens of trillions of dollars injected into the global economy
ted_01375_0788400_0801430 and they will get healthier by using the tricorder and they &apos;ll become better educated by using the khan academy and by literally being able to use 3d printing and infinite computing become more productive than ever before
ted_01375_0802650_0809330 so what could three billion rising healthy educated productive members of humanity bring to us
ted_01375_0810930_0813310 how about a set of voices that have never been heard from before
ted_01375_0814240_0821490 what about giving the oppressed wherever they might be the voice to be heard and the voice to act for the first time ever
ted_01375_0822410_0823950 what will these three billion people bring
ted_01375_0825410_0828490 what about contributions we can &apos;t even predict
ted_01375_0829030_0841390 the one thing i &apos;ve learned at the x prize is that small teams driven by their passion with a clear focus can do extraordinary things things that large corporations and governments could only do in the past
ted_01375_0842280_0846280 let me share and close with a story that really got me excited
ted_01375_0847880_0849820 there is a program that some of you might have heard of
ted_01375_0849820_0850700 it &apos;s a game called foldit
ted_01375_0851020_0854490 it came out of the university of washington in seattle
ted_01375_0855670_0864420 and this is a game where individuals can actually take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how the protein is going to fold
ted_01375_0865520_0868180 and how it folds dictates its structure and its functionality
ted_01375_0868180_0869900 and it &apos;s very important for research in medicine
ted_01375_0870080_0872320 and up until now it &apos;s been a supercomputer problem
ted_01375_0873990_0882390 and this game has been played by university professors and so forth and it &apos;s literally hundreds of thousands of people came online and started playing it
ted_01375_0882420_0888700 and it showed that in fact today the human pattern recognition machinery is better at folding proteins than the best computers
ted_01375_0889790_0911870 and when these individuals went and looked at who was the best protein folder in the world it wasn &apos;t an mit professor it wasn &apos;t a caltech student it was a person from england from manchester a woman who during the day was an executive assistant at a rehab clinic and at night was the world &apos;s best protein folder
ted_01375_0914570_0927820 ladies and gentlemen what gives me tremendous confidence in the future is the fact that we are now more empowered as individuals to take on the grand challenges of this planet
ted_01375_0928550_0931300 we have the tools with this exponential technology
ted_01375_0931560_0933820 we have the passion of the diy innovator
ted_01375_0934040_0937200 we have the capital of the technophilanthropist
ted_01375_0937450_0945870 and we have three billion new minds coming online to work with us to solve the grand challenges to do that which we must do
ted_01375_0947200_0949760 we are living into extraordinary decades ahead
ted_01375_0950050_0962780 thank you
ted_01375_0962705_0962905 applause
ted_01378_0012730_0015890 well this is a really extraordinary honor for me
ted_01378_0015920_0019960 i spend most of my time in jails in prisons on death row
ted_01378_0020580_0026380 i spend most of my time in very lowincome communities in the projects and places where there &apos;s a great deal of hopelessness
ted_01378_0026930_0032410 and being here at ted and seeing the stimulation hearing it has been very very energizing to me
ted_01378_0032410_0036930 and one of the things that &apos;s emerged in my short time here is that ted has an identity
ted_01378_0037870_0042430 and you can actually say things here that have impacts around the world
ted_01378_0042430_0048750 and sometimes when it comes through ted it has meaning and power that it doesn &apos;t have when it doesn &apos;t
ted_01378_0049460_0052240 and i mention that because i think identity is really important
ted_01378_0052780_0055340 and we &apos;ve had some fantastic presentations
ted_01378_0055720_0062960 and i think what we &apos;ve learned is that if you &apos;re a teacher your words can be meaningful but if you &apos;re a compassionate teacher they can be especially meaningful
ted_01378_0063570_0068020 if you &apos;re a doctor you can do some good things but if you &apos;re a caring doctor you can do some other things
ted_01378_0068620_0071090 and so i want to talk about the power of identity
ted_01378_0071960_0075780 and i didn &apos;t learn about this actually practicing law and doing the work that i do
ted_01378_0075780_0078290 i actually learned about this from my grandmother
ted_01378_0078340_0086310 i grew up in a house that was the traditional africanamerican home that was dominated by a matriarch and that matriarch was my grandmother
ted_01378_0086980_0090390 she was tough she was strong she was powerful
ted_01378_0091250_0094050 she was the end of every argument in our family
ted_01378_0095200_0097880 she was the beginning of a lot of arguments in our family
ted_01378_0098660_0101030 she was the daughter of people who were actually enslaved
ted_01378_0101390_0104350 her parents were born in slavery in virginia in the 1840 &apos;s
ted_01378_0104350_0109710 she was born in the 1880 &apos;s and the experience of slavery very much shaped the way she saw the world
ted_01378_0110880_0112930 and my grandmother was tough but she was also loving
ted_01378_0112940_0115860 when i would see her as a little boy she &apos;d come up to me and she &apos;d give me these hugs
ted_01378_0115860_0120220 and she &apos;d squeeze me so tight i could barely breathe and then she &apos;d let me go
ted_01378_0121020_0129870 and an hour or two later if i saw her she &apos;d come over to me and she &apos;d say bryan do you still feel me hugging you and if i said no she &apos;d assault me again and if i said yes she &apos;d leave me alone
ted_01378_0129920_0133010 and she just had this quality that you always wanted to be near her
ted_01378_0133740_0136220 and the only challenge was that she had 10 children
ted_01378_0136220_0138060 my mom was the youngest of her 10 kids
ted_01378_0138060_0142420 and sometimes when i would go and spend time with her it would be difficult to get her time and attention
ted_01378_0142430_0144230 my cousins would be running around everywhere
ted_01378_0144230_0151120 and i remember when i was about eight or nine years old waking up one morning going into the living room and all of my cousins were running around
ted_01378_0151530_0154740 and my grandmother was sitting across the room staring at me
ted_01378_0155540_0157550 and at first i thought we were playing a game
ted_01378_0158320_0160910 and i would look at her and i &apos;d smile but she was very serious
ted_01378_0161720_0168940 and after about 15 or 20 minutes of this she got up and she came across the room and she took me by the hand and she said come on bryan
ted_01378_0168940_0173760 you and i are going to have a talk and i remember this just like it happened yesterday
ted_01378_0174560_0175500 i never will forget it
ted_01378_0176460_0202040 she took me out back and she said bryan i &apos;m going to tell you something but you don &apos;t tell anybody what i tell you i said okay mama she said now you make sure you don &apos;t do that i said sure then she sat me down and she looked at me and she said i want you to know i &apos;ve been watching you and she said i think you &apos;re special she said i think you can do anything you want to do i will never forget it
ted_01378_0203550_0217800 and then she said i just need you to promise me three things bryan i said okay mama she said the first thing i want you to promise me is that you &apos;ll always love your mom she said that &apos;s my baby girl and you have to promise me now you &apos;ll always take care of her well i adored my mom so i said yes mama
ted_01378_0217800_0228910 i &apos;ll do that then she said the second thing i want you to promise me is that you &apos;ll always do the right thing even when the right thing is the hard thing and i thought about it and i said yes mama
ted_01378_0228920_0239460 i &apos;ll do that then finally she said the third thing i want you to promise me is that you &apos;ll never drink alcohol laughter well i was nine years old so i said yes mama
ted_01378_0239460_0240200 i &apos;ll do that
ted_01378_0240840_0245150 i grew up in the country in the rural south and i have a brother a year older than me and a sister a year younger
ted_01378_0245170_0253470 when i was about 14 or 15 one day my brother came home and he had this sixpack of beer i don &apos;t know where he got it and he grabbed me and my sister and we went out in the woods
ted_01378_0253470_0256390 and we were kind of just out there doing the stuff we crazily did
ted_01378_0256390_0261310 and he had a sip of this beer and he gave some to my sister and she had some and they offered it to me
ted_01378_0261930_0265560 i said no no no that &apos;s okay you all go ahead i &apos;m not going to have any beer my brother said come on
ted_01378_0265560_0267420 we &apos;re doing this today you always do what we do
ted_01378_0267450_0271260 i had some your sister had some have some beer i said no i don &apos;t feel right about that
ted_01378_0271260_0273850 y &apos;all go ahead y &apos;all go ahead and then my brother started staring at me
ted_01378_0273850_0275090 he said what &apos;s wrong with you
ted_01378_0275340_0294390 have some beer then he looked at me real hard and he said oh i hope you &apos;re not still hung up on that conversation mama had with you laughter i said well what are you talking about he said oh mama tells all the grandkids that they &apos;re special laughter i was devastated
ted_01378_0294325_0294525 laughter
ted_01378_0297120_0298440 and i &apos;m going to admit something to you
ted_01378_0298440_0300180 i &apos;m going to tell you something i probably shouldn &apos;t
ted_01378_0300180_0302200 i know this might be broadcast broadly
ted_01378_0302200_0317410 but i &apos;m 52 years old and i &apos;m going to admit to you that i &apos;ve never had a drop of alcohol applause i don &apos;t say that because i think that &apos;s virtuous i say that because there is power in identity
ted_01378_0318260_0324900 when we create the right kind of identity we can say things to the world around us that they don &apos;t actually believe makes sense
ted_01378_0324900_0328380 we can get them to do things that they don &apos;t think they can do
ted_01378_0329070_0332570 when i thought about my grandmother of course she would think all her grandkids were special
ted_01378_0332830_0335000 my grandfather was in prison during prohibition
ted_01378_0335030_0337470 my male uncles died of alcoholrelated diseases
ted_01378_0337690_0340180 and these were the things she thought we needed to commit to
ted_01378_0341130_0343770 well i &apos;ve been trying to say something about our criminal justice system
ted_01378_0344640_0348250 this country is very different today than it was 40 years ago
ted_01378_0348310_0351260 in 1972 there were 300000 people in jails and prisons
ted_01378_0351380_0354380 today there are 23 million
ted_01378_0356620_0360190 the united states now has the highest rate of incarceration in the world
ted_01378_0360480_0363410 we have seven million people on probation and parole
ted_01378_0363440_0368700 and mass incarceration in my judgment has fundamentally changed our world
ted_01378_0370180_0377570 in poor communities in communities of color there is this despair there is this hopelessness that is being shaped by these outcomes
ted_01378_0378110_0384300 one out of three black men between the ages of 18 and 30 is in jail in prison on probation or parole
ted_01378_0385430_0395450 in urban communities across this country los angeles philadelphia baltimore washington 50 to 60 percent of all young men of color are in jail or prison or on probation or parole
ted_01378_0395980_0401790 our system isn &apos;t just being shaped in these ways that seem to be distorting around race they &apos;re also distorted by poverty
ted_01378_0401790_0409800 we have a system of justice in this country that treats you much better if you &apos;re rich and guilty than if you &apos;re poor and innocent
ted_01378_0409900_0413580 wealth not culpability shapes outcomes
ted_01378_0414690_0417360 and yet we seem to be very comfortable
ted_01378_0418420_0423380 the politics of fear and anger have made us believe that these are problems that are not our problems
ted_01378_0424360_0425570 we &apos;ve been disconnected
ted_01378_0426940_0427860 it &apos;s interesting to me
ted_01378_0427860_0430520 we &apos;re looking at some very interesting developments in our work
ted_01378_0430700_0436670 my state of alabama like a number of states actually permanently disenfranchises you if you have a criminal conviction
ted_01378_0436670_0442780 right now in alabama 34 percent of the black male population has permanently lost the right to vote
ted_01378_0443390_0450610 we &apos;re actually projecting in another 10 years the level of disenfranchisement will be as high as it &apos;s been since prior to the passage of the voting rights act
ted_01378_0450650_0453060 and there is this stunning silence
ted_01378_0455090_0458470 i represent children a lot of my clients are very young
ted_01378_0458480_0463780 the united states is the only country in the world where we sentence 13yearold children to die in prison
ted_01378_0464550_0467320 we have life imprisonment without parole for kids in this country
ted_01378_0468020_0469650 and we &apos;re actually doing some litigation
ted_01378_0470050_0471200 the only country in the world
ted_01378_0472120_0473490 i represent people on death row
ted_01378_0473500_0475520 it &apos;s interesting this question of the death penalty
ted_01378_0476510_0482560 in many ways we &apos;ve been taught to think that the real question is do people deserve to die for the crimes they &apos;ve committed
ted_01378_0482590_0484420 and that &apos;s a very sensible question
ted_01378_0485130_0488190 but there &apos;s another way of thinking about where we are in our identity
ted_01378_0488830_0494810 the other way of thinking about it is not do people deserve to die for the crimes they commit but do we deserve to kill
ted_01378_0494820_0496610 i mean it &apos;s fascinating
ted_01378_0496610_0498880 death penalty in america is defined by error
ted_01378_0499480_0506450 for every nine people who have been executed we &apos;ve actually identified one innocent person who &apos;s been exonerated and released from death row
ted_01378_0507510_0512060 a kind of astonishing error rate one out of nine people innocent
ted_01378_0512880_0513720 i mean it &apos;s fascinating
ted_01378_0513720_0520190 in aviation we would never let people fly on airplanes if for every nine planes that took off one would crash
ted_01378_0521100_0524350 but somehow we can insulate ourselves from this problem
ted_01378_0524970_0526110 it &apos;s not our problem
ted_01378_0526590_0527720 it &apos;s not our burden
ted_01378_0527950_0529090 it &apos;s not our struggle
ted_01378_0530480_0531940 i talk a lot about these issues
ted_01378_0531940_0536010 i talk about race and this question of whether we deserve to kill
ted_01378_0536010_0540570 and it &apos;s interesting when i teach my students about africanamerican history i tell them about slavery
ted_01378_0540940_0546310 i tell them about terrorism the era that began at the end of reconstruction that went on to world war ii
ted_01378_0546520_0547940 we don &apos;t really know very much about it
ted_01378_0547940_0552180 but for africanamericans in this country that was an era defined by terror
ted_01378_0552910_0555610 in many communities people had to worry about being lynched
ted_01378_0555620_0556870 they had to worry about being bombed
ted_01378_0556870_0559000 it was the threat of terror that shaped their lives
ted_01378_0559000_0580980 and these older people come up to me now and they say mr stevenson you give talks you make speeches you tell people to stop saying we &apos;re dealing with terrorism for the first time in our nation &apos;s history after 9 11 they tell me to say no tell them that we grew up with that and that era of terrorism of course was followed by segregation and decades of racial subordination and apartheid
ted_01378_0582250_0587890 and yet we have in this country this dynamic where we really don &apos;t like to talk about our problems
ted_01378_0587890_0589910 we don &apos;t like to talk about our history
ted_01378_0590410_0596140 and because of that we really haven &apos;t understood what it &apos;s meant to do the things we &apos;ve done historically
ted_01378_0596870_0598430 we &apos;re constantly running into each other
ted_01378_0598430_0600860 we &apos;re constantly creating tensions and conflicts
ted_01378_0601130_0609420 we have a hard time talking about race and i believe it &apos;s because we are unwilling to commit ourselves to a process of truth and reconciliation
ted_01378_0609420_0615780 in south africa people understood that we couldn &apos;t overcome apartheid without a commitment to truth and reconciliation
ted_01378_0616380_0620490 in rwanda even after the genocide there was this commitment but in this country we haven &apos;t done that
ted_01378_0621010_0624570 i was giving some lectures in germany about the death penalty
ted_01378_0624570_0635010 it was fascinating because one of the scholars stood up after the presentation and said well you know it &apos;s deeply troubling to hear what you &apos;re talking about he said we don &apos;t have the death penalty in germany
ted_01378_0635010_0649700 and of course we can never have the death penalty in germany and the room got very quiet and this woman said there &apos;s no way with our history we could ever engage in the systematic killing of human beings
ted_01378_0650210_0659840 it would be unconscionable for us to in an intentional and deliberate way set about executing people and i thought about that
ted_01378_0660920_0669170 what would it feel like to be living in a world where the nation state of germany was executing people especially if they were disproportionately jewish
ted_01378_0669200_0673000 i couldn &apos;t bear it it would be unconscionable
ted_01378_0673660_0691310 and yet in this country in the states of the old south we execute people where you &apos;re 11 times more likely to get the death penalty if the victim is white than if the victim is black 22 times more likely to get it if the defendant is black and the victim is white in the very states where there are buried in the ground the bodies of people who were lynched
ted_01378_0691480_0693780 and yet there is this disconnect
ted_01378_0695700_0698520 well i believe that our identity is at risk
ted_01378_0700060_0728510 that when we actually don &apos;t care about these difficult things the positive and wonderful things are nonetheless implicated we love innovation we love technology we love creativity we love entertainment but ultimately those realities are shadowed by suffering abuse degradation marginalization
ted_01378_0729330_0732160 and for me it becomes necessary to integrate the two
ted_01378_0733150_0742560 because ultimately we are talking about a need to be more hopeful more committed more dedicated to the basic challenges of living in a complex world
ted_01378_0742840_0752030 and for me that means spending time thinking and talking about the poor the disadvantaged those who will never get to ted
ted_01378_0752920_0756600 but thinking about them in a way that is integrated in our own lives
ted_01378_0757240_0763800 you know ultimately we all have to believe things we haven &apos;t seen we do as rational as we are as committed to intellect as we are
ted_01378_0764130_0770960 innovation creativity development comes not from the ideas in our mind alone
ted_01378_0770970_0776310 they come from the ideas in our mind that are also fueled by some conviction in our heart
ted_01378_0777230_0789020 and it &apos;s that mindheart connection that i believe compels us to not just be attentive to all the bright and dazzly things but also the dark and difficult things
ted_01378_0790230_0792160 vaclav havel the great czech leader talked about this
ted_01378_0792160_0804770 he said when we were in eastern europe and dealing with oppression we wanted all kinds of things but mostly what we needed was hope an orientation of the spirit a willingness to sometimes be in hopeless places and be a witness
ted_01378_0805460_0814250 well that orientation of the spirit is very much at the core of what i believe even ted communities have to be engaged in
ted_01378_0815070_0827920 there is no disconnect around technology and design that will allow us to be fully human until we pay attention to suffering to poverty to exclusion to unfairness to injustice
ted_01378_0827920_0836450 now i will warn you that this kind of identity is a much more challenging identity than ones that don &apos;t pay attention to this
ted_01378_0837400_0838320 it will get to you
ted_01378_0838450_0841680 i had the great privilege when i was a young lawyer of meeting rosa parks
ted_01378_0841710_0858850 and ms parks used to come back to montgomery every now and then and she would get together with two of her dearest friends these older women johnnie carr who was the organizer of the montgomery bus boycott amazing africanamerican woman and virginia durr a white woman whose husband clifford durr represented dr king
ted_01378_0858850_0860810 and these women would get together and just talk
ted_01378_0861150_0865530 and every now and then ms carr would call me and she &apos;d say bryan ms parks is coming to town
ted_01378_0865540_0866600 we &apos;re going to get together and talk
ted_01378_0866600_0875980 do you want to come over and listen and i &apos;d say yes ma &apos;am i do and she &apos;d say well what are you going to do when you get here i said i &apos;m going to listen and i &apos;d go over there and i would i would just listen
ted_01378_0875980_0878420 it would be so energizing and so empowering
ted_01378_0878420_0886370 and one time i was over there listening to these women talk and after a couple of hours ms parks turned to me and she said now bryan tell me what the equal justice initiative is
ted_01378_0886370_0889820 tell me what you &apos;re trying to do and i began giving her my rap
ted_01378_0889820_0892610 i said well we &apos;re trying to challenge injustice
ted_01378_0892610_0894950 we &apos;re trying to help people who have been wrongly convicted
ted_01378_0894950_0898830 we &apos;re trying to confront bias and discrimination in the administration of criminal justice
ted_01378_0898830_0902070 we &apos;re trying to end life without parole sentences for children
ted_01378_0902070_0903680 we &apos;re trying to do something about the death penalty
ted_01378_0903680_0905770 we &apos;re trying to reduce the prison population
ted_01378_0905770_0907210 we &apos;re trying to end mass incarceration
ted_01378_0907210_0924410 i gave her my whole rap and when i finished she looked at me and she said mmm mmm mmm she said that &apos;s going to make you tired tired tired laughter and that &apos;s when ms carr leaned forward she put her finger in my face she said that &apos;s why you &apos;ve got to be brave brave brave
ted_01378_0925920_0930190 and i actually believe that the ted community needs to be more courageous
ted_01378_0931270_0940950 we need to find ways to embrace these challenges these problems the suffering because ultimately our humanity depends on everyone &apos;s humanity
ted_01378_0941450_0943560 i &apos;ve learned very simple things doing the work that i do
ted_01378_0943670_0945210 it &apos;s just taught me very simple things
ted_01378_0945270_0952080 i &apos;ve come to understand and to believe that each of us is more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done
ted_01378_0952630_0955340 i believe that for every person on the planet
ted_01378_0956140_0958720 i think if somebody tells a lie they &apos;re not just a liar
ted_01378_0959290_0962420 i think if somebody takes something that doesn &apos;t belong to them they &apos;re not just a thief
ted_01378_0962420_0965550 i think even if you kill someone you &apos;re not just a killer
ted_01378_0966060_0970170 and because of that there &apos;s this basic human dignity that must be respected by law
ted_01378_0971210_0980660 i also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of this globe that the opposite of poverty is not wealth
ted_01378_0981740_0982470 i don &apos;t believe that
ted_01378_0983030_0988300 i actually think in too many places the opposite of poverty is justice
ted_01378_0989070_1006980 and finally i believe that despite the fact that it is so dramatic and so beautiful and so inspiring and so stimulating we will ultimately not be judged by our technology we won &apos;t be judged by our design we won &apos;t be judged by our intellect and reason
ted_01378_1007000_1017930 ultimately you judge the character of a society not by how they treat their rich and the powerful and the privileged but by how they treat the poor the condemned the incarcerated
ted_01378_1018310_1024310 because it &apos;s in that nexus that we actually begin to understand truly profound things about who we are
ted_01378_1026550_1027670 i sometimes get out of balance
ted_01378_1027670_1028570 i &apos;ll end with this story
ted_01378_1028570_1030130 i sometimes push too hard
ted_01378_1030650_1032450 i do get tired as we all do
ted_01378_1032740_1037100 sometimes those ideas get ahead of our thinking in ways that are important
ted_01378_1037970_1041970 and i &apos;ve been representing these kids who have been sentenced to do these very harsh sentences
ted_01378_1041970_1047170 and i go to the jail and i see my client who &apos;s 13 and 14 and he &apos;s been certified to stand trial as an adult
ted_01378_1047200_1049050 i start thinking well how did that happen
ted_01378_1049540_1052280 how can a judge turn you into something that you &apos;re not
ted_01378_1053370_1055920 and the judge has certified him as an adult but i see this kid
ted_01378_1055920_1062520 and i was up too late one night and i starting thinking well gosh if the judge can turn you into something that you &apos;re not the judge must have magic power
ted_01378_1063510_1065320 yeah bryan the judge has some magic power
ted_01378_1065330_1066710 you should ask for some of that
ted_01378_1067280_1070690 and because i was up too late wasn &apos;t thinking real straight i started working on a motion
ted_01378_1071350_1074300 and i had a client who was 14 years old a young poor black kid
ted_01378_1074300_1083780 and i started working on this motion and the head of the motion was motion to try my poor 14yearold black male client like a privileged white 75yearold corporate executive
ted_01378_1088915_1089115 applause
ted_01378_1089840_1094440 and i put in my motion that there was prosecutorial misconduct and police misconduct and judicial misconduct
ted_01378_1094440_1098100 there was a crazy line in there about how there &apos;s no conduct in this county it &apos;s all misconduct
ted_01378_1098100_1103230 and the next morning i woke up and i thought now did i dream that crazy motion or did i actually write it
ted_01378_1103230_1107400 and to my horror not only had i written it but i had sent it to court
ted_01378_1110480_1110680 applause
ted_01378_1111020_1115220 a couple months went by and i had just forgotten all about it
ted_01378_1115790_1119940 and i finally decided oh gosh i &apos;ve got to go to the court and do this crazy case
ted_01378_1119940_1122990 and i got into my car and i was feeling really overwhelmed overwhelmed
ted_01378_1123970_1125920 and i got in my car and i went to this courthouse
ted_01378_1125920_1128740 and i was thinking this is going to be so difficult so painful
ted_01378_1129200_1131920 and i finally got out of the car and i started walking up to the courthouse
ted_01378_1131930_1137140 and as i was walking up the steps of this courthouse there was an older black man who was the janitor in this courthouse
ted_01378_1137200_1146400 when this man saw me he came over to me and he said who are you i said i &apos;m a lawyer he said you &apos;re a lawyer i said yes sir and this man came over to me and he hugged me
ted_01378_1147410_1148600 and he whispered in my ear
ted_01378_1148600_1154420 he said i &apos;m so proud of you and i have to tell you it was energizing
ted_01378_1155220_1164960 it connected deeply with something in me about identity about the capacity of every person to contribute to a community to a perspective that is hopeful
ted_01378_1165650_1166490 well i went into the courtroom
ted_01378_1166490_1168620 and as soon as i walked inside the judge saw me coming in
ted_01378_1168620_1172240 he said mr stevenson did you write this crazy motion i said yes sir
ted_01378_1172240_1173560 i did and we started arguing
ted_01378_1173630_1175950 and people started coming in because they were just outraged
ted_01378_1175950_1177540 i had written these crazy things
ted_01378_1178110_1181090 and police officers were coming in and assistant prosecutors and clerk workers
ted_01378_1181320_1189140 and before i knew it the courtroom was filled with people angry that we were talking about race that we were talking about poverty that we were talking about inequality
ted_01378_1189910_1193040 and out of the corner of my eye i could see this janitor pacing back and forth
ted_01378_1193040_1195140 and he kept looking through the window and he could hear all of this holler
ted_01378_1195140_1196330 he kept pacing back and forth
ted_01378_1196650_1203670 and finally this older black man with this very worried look on his face came into the courtroom and sat down behind me almost at counsel table
ted_01378_1204650_1206590 about 10 minutes later the judge said we would take a break
ted_01378_1206590_1210870 and during the break there was a deputy sheriff who was offended that the janitor had come into court
ted_01378_1211710_1213900 and this deputy jumped up and he ran over to this older black man
ted_01378_1213900_1228210 he said jimmy what are you doing in this courtroom and this older black man stood up and he looked at that deputy and he looked at me and he said i came into this courtroom to tell this young man keep your eyes on the prize hold on
ted_01378_1229180_1236870 i &apos;ve come to ted because i believe that many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is long but it bends toward justice
ted_01378_1237180_1242080 that we cannot be full evolved human beings until we care about human rights and basic dignity
ted_01378_1242560_1246070 that all of our survival is tied to the survival of everyone
ted_01378_1246560_1255880 that our visions of technology and design and entertainment and creativity have to be married with visions of humanity compassion and justice
ted_01378_1256120_1263820 and more than anything for those of you who share that i &apos;ve simply come to tell you to keep your eyes on the prize hold on
ted_01378_1264060_1264870 thank you very much
ted_01378_1285645_1285845 applause
ted_01378_1285770_1294520 chris anderson so you heard and saw an obvious desire by this audience this community to help you on your way and to do something on this issue
ted_01378_1294540_1299070 other than writing a check what could we do
ted_01378_1299080_1301260 bs well there are opportunities all around us
ted_01378_1301290_1310540 if you live in the state of california for example there &apos;s a referendum coming up this spring where actually there &apos;s going to be an effort to redirect some of the money we spend on the politics of punishment
ted_01378_1310550_1318290 for example here in california we &apos;re going to spend one billion dollars on the death penalty in the next five years one billion dollars
ted_01378_1319240_1322950 and yet 46 percent of all homicide cases don &apos;t result in arrest
ted_01378_1323870_1325600 56 percent of all rape cases don &apos;t result
ted_01378_1325640_1327260 so there &apos;s an opportunity to change that
ted_01378_1327410_1332530 and this referendum would propose having those dollars go to law enforcement and safety
ted_01378_1332850_1335020 and i think that opportunity exists all around us
ted_01378_1335450_1340170 ca there &apos;s been this huge decline in crime in america over the last three decades
ted_01378_1340170_1346210 and part of the narrative of that is sometimes that it &apos;s about increased incarceration rates
ted_01378_1346230_1347790 what would you say to someone who believed that
ted_01378_1347800_1351010 bs well actually the violent crime rate has remained relatively stable
ted_01378_1351580_1356220 the great increase in mass incarceration in this country wasn &apos;t really in violent crime categories
ted_01378_1356220_1358250 it was this misguided war on drugs
ted_01378_1358490_1361380 that &apos;s where the dramatic increases have come in our prison population
ted_01378_1363920_1366570 and we got carried away with the rhetoric of punishment
ted_01378_1366570_1376910 and so we have three strikes laws that put people in prison forever for stealing a bicycle for lowlevel property crimes rather than making them give those resources back to the people who they victimized
ted_01378_1377170_1381560 i believe we need to do more to help people who are victimized by crime not do less
ted_01378_1381650_1385130 and i think our current punishment philosophy does nothing for no one
ted_01378_1385480_1387300 and i think that &apos;s the orientation that we have to change
ted_01378_1389805_1390005 applause
ted_01378_1389930_1392600 ca bryan you &apos;ve struck a massive chord here
ted_01378_1392850_1393710 you &apos;re an inspiring person
ted_01378_1394340_1396090 thank you so much for coming to ted thank you
ted_01381_0013950_0028020 so a couple of years ago i started a program to try to get the rockstar tech and design people to take a year off and work in the one environment that represents pretty much everything they &apos;re supposed to hate we have them work in government
ted_01381_0030220_0040280 the program is called code for america and it &apos;s a little bit like a peace corps for geeks we select a few fellows every year and we have them work with city governments
ted_01381_0040720_0045170 instead of sending them off into the third world we send them into the wilds of city hall
ted_01381_0045560_0047990 and there they make great apps they work with city staffers
ted_01381_0048040_0052230 but really what they &apos;re doing is they &apos;re showing what &apos;s possible with technology today
ted_01381_0053380_0057130 so meet al al is a fire hydrant in the city of boston
ted_01381_0057730_0068290 here it kind of looks like he &apos;s looking for a date but what he &apos;s really looking for is for someone to shovel him out when he gets snowed in because he knows he &apos;s not very good at fighting fires when he &apos;s covered in four feet of snow
ted_01381_0068670_0071910 now how did he come to be looking for help in this very unique manner
ted_01381_0072940_0076460 we had a team of fellows in boston last year through the code for america program
ted_01381_0076460_0079810 they were there in february and it snowed a lot in february last year
ted_01381_0080130_0083440 and they noticed that the city never gets to digging out these fire hydrants
ted_01381_0083440_0093070 but one fellow in particular a guy named erik michaelsober noticed something else and that &apos;s that citizens are shoveling out sidewalks right in front of these things
ted_01381_0093700_0096390 so he did what any good developer would do he wrote an app
ted_01381_0097120_0099690 it &apos;s a cute little app where you can adopt a fire hydrant
ted_01381_0099880_0102020 so you agree to dig it out when it snows
ted_01381_0102050_0104560 if you do you get to name it and he called the first one al
ted_01381_0105990_0107690 and if you don &apos;t someone can steal it from you
ted_01381_0107690_0110170 so it &apos;s got cute little game dynamics on it
ted_01381_0111650_0112990 this is a modest little app
ted_01381_0112990_0116370 it &apos;s probably the smallest of the 21 apps that the fellows wrote last year
ted_01381_0116790_0120120 but it &apos;s doing something that no other government technology does
ted_01381_0120700_0122330 it &apos;s spreading virally
ted_01381_0123300_0133720 there &apos;s a guy in the it department of the city of honolulu who saw this app and realized that he could use it not for snow but to get citizens to adopt tsunami sirens
ted_01381_0134460_0138830 it &apos;s very important that these tsunami sirens work but people steal the batteries out of them
ted_01381_0138830_0140670 so he &apos;s getting citizens to check on them
ted_01381_0141130_0145860 and then seattle decided to use it to get citizens to clear out clogged storm drains
ted_01381_0146500_0150530 and chicago just rolled it out to get people to sign up to shovel sidewalks when it snows
ted_01381_0151450_0155250 so we now know of nine cities that are planning to use this
ted_01381_0155570_0159190 and this has spread just frictionlessly organically naturally
ted_01381_0159920_0164690 if you know anything about government technology you know that this isn &apos;t how it normally goes
ted_01381_0165270_0167730 procuring software usually takes a couple of years
ted_01381_0168650_0174020 we had a team that worked on a project in boston last year that took three people about two and a half months
ted_01381_0174240_0178260 it was a way that parents could figure out which were the right public schools for their kids
ted_01381_0179100_0187030 we were told afterward that if that had gone through normal channels it would have taken at least two years and it would have cost about two million dollars
ted_01381_0188000_0188840 and that &apos;s nothing
ted_01381_0188850_0196990 there is one project in the california court system right now that so far cost taxpayers two billion dollars and it doesn &apos;t work
ted_01381_0197840_0200790 and there are projects like this at every level of government
ted_01381_0201910_0210530 so an app that takes a couple of days to write and then spreads virally that &apos;s sort of a shot across the bow to the institution of government
ted_01381_0211070_0217150 it suggests how government could work better not more like a private company as many people think it should
ted_01381_0217150_0221930 and not even like a tech company but more like the internet itself
ted_01381_0222480_0226400 and that means permissionless it means open it means generative
ted_01381_0228950_0230090 and that &apos;s important
ted_01381_0230610_0242490 but what &apos;s more important about this app is that it represents how a new generation is tackling the problem of government not as the problem of an ossified institution but as a problem of collective action
ted_01381_0243490_0248750 and that &apos;s great news because it turns out we &apos;re very good at collective action with digital technology
ted_01381_0249730_0255280 now there &apos;s a very large community of people that are building the tools that we need to do things together effectively
ted_01381_0255930_0264450 it &apos;s not just code for america fellows there are hundreds of people all over the country that are standing and writing civic apps every day in their own communities
ted_01381_0265630_0267350 they haven &apos;t given up on government
ted_01381_0268130_0272910 they are frustrated as hell with it but they &apos;re not complaining about it they &apos;re fixing it
ted_01381_0273950_0276510 and these folks know something that we &apos;ve lost sight of
ted_01381_0277260_0293160 and that &apos;s that when you strip away all your feelings about politics and the line at the dmv and all those other things that we &apos;re really mad about government is at its core in the words of tim o &apos;reilly what we do together that we can &apos;t do alone
ted_01381_0295770_0297620 now a lot of people have given up on government
ted_01381_0297950_0303770 and if you &apos;re one of those people i would ask that you reconsider because things are changing
ted_01381_0304810_0308370 politics is not changing government is changing
ted_01381_0309650_0318650 and because government ultimately derives its power from us remember we the people how we think about it is going to effect how that change happens
ted_01381_0320370_0323320 now i didn &apos;t know very much about government when i started this program
ted_01381_0323380_0327310 and like a lot of people i thought government was basically about getting people elected to office
ted_01381_0328290_0334220 well after two years i &apos;ve come to the conclusion that especially local government is about opossums
ted_01381_0335610_0338610 this is the call center for the services and information line
ted_01381_0338620_0342090 it &apos;s generally where you will get if you call 311 in your city
ted_01381_0343090_0357940 if you should ever have the chance to staff your city &apos;s call center as our fellow scott silverman did as part of the program in fact they all do that you will find that people call government with a very wide range of issues including having an opossum stuck in your house
ted_01381_0358410_0359700 so scott gets this call
ted_01381_0359700_0362380 he types opossum into this official knowledge base
ted_01381_0363290_0364680 he doesn &apos;t really come up with anything
ted_01381_0364680_0366000 he starts with animal control
ted_01381_0366000_0373430 and finally he says look can you just open all the doors to your house and play music really loud and see if the thing leaves so that worked
ted_01381_0373430_0374930 so booya for scott
ted_01381_0376000_0377780 but that wasn &apos;t the end of the opossums
ted_01381_0377950_0379970 boston doesn &apos;t just have a call center
ted_01381_0380460_0383210 it has an app a web and mobile app called citizens connect
ted_01381_0383550_0384640 now we didn &apos;t write this app
ted_01381_0384640_0388840 this is the work of the very smart people at the office of new urban mechanics in boston
ted_01381_0389090_0394350 so one day this is an actual report this came in opossum in my trashcan
ted_01381_0394350_0395440 can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s dead
ted_01381_0395550_0400450 how do i get this removed but what happens with citizens connect is different
ted_01381_0400450_0403040 so scott was speaking persontoperson
ted_01381_0403670_0407280 but on citizens connect everything is public so everybody can see this
ted_01381_0407510_0409350 and in this case a neighbor saw it
ted_01381_0409400_0421930 and the next report we got said i walked over to this location found the trashcan behind the house opossum check living yep turned trashcan on its side walked home goodnight sweet opossum
ted_01381_0424605_0424805 laughter
ted_01381_0424730_0427750 pretty simple so this is great
ted_01381_0427760_0429890 this is the digital meeting the physical
ted_01381_0430180_0433720 and it &apos;s also a great example of government getting in on the crowdsourcing game
ted_01381_0434260_0437170 but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform
ted_01381_0437780_0441550 and i don &apos;t mean necessarily a technological definition of platform here
ted_01381_0441550_0446130 i &apos;m just talking about a platform for people to help themselves and to help others
ted_01381_0447280_0451650 so one citizen helped another citizen but government played a key role here
ted_01381_0451650_0453470 it connected those two people
ted_01381_0454390_0461870 and it could have connected them with government services if they &apos;d been needed but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative to government services
ted_01381_0462400_0466030 when one neighbor helps another we strengthen our communities
ted_01381_0466630_0469390 we call animal control it just costs a lot of money
ted_01381_0471430_0476760 now one of the important things we need to think about government is that it &apos;s not the same thing as politics
ted_01381_0477070_0480720 and most people get that but they think that one is the input to the other
ted_01381_0481260_0484230 that our input to the system of government is voting
ted_01381_0485380_0500960 now how many times have we elected a political leader and sometimes we spend a lot of energy getting a new political leader elected and then we sit back and we expect government to reflect our values and meet our needs and then not that much changes
ted_01381_0502490_0508680 that &apos;s because government is like a vast ocean and politics is the sixinch layer on top
ted_01381_0509520_0512440 and what &apos;s under that is what we call bureaucracy
ted_01381_0513910_0516600 and we say that word with such contempt
ted_01381_0517210_0529140 but it &apos;s that contempt that keeps this thing that we own and we pay for as something that &apos;s working against us this other thing and then we &apos;re disempowering ourselves
ted_01381_0530100_0532270 people seem to think politics is sexy
ted_01381_0532760_0537780 if we want this institution to work for us we &apos;re going to have to make bureaucracy sexy
ted_01381_0538750_0541480 because that &apos;s where the real work of government happens
ted_01381_0542330_0544720 we have to engage with the machinery of government
ted_01381_0545100_0547880 so that &apos;s occupythesec movement has done
ted_01381_0547880_0548940 have you seen these guys
ted_01381_0549260_0559350 it &apos;s a group of concerned citizens that have written a very detailed 325page report that &apos;s a response to the sec &apos;s request for comment on the financial reform bill
ted_01381_0559940_0564010 that &apos;s not being politically active that &apos;s being bureaucratically active
ted_01381_0566040_0572780 now for those of us who &apos;ve given up on government it &apos;s time that we asked ourselves about the world that we want to leave for our children
ted_01381_0573770_0577430 you have to see the enormous challenges that they &apos;re going to face
ted_01381_0578520_0585630 do we really think we &apos;re going to get where we need to go without fixing the one institution that can act on behalf of all of us
ted_01381_0586350_0590840 we can &apos;t do without government but we do need it to be more effective
ted_01381_0591580_0602020 the good news is that technology is making it possible to fundamentally reframe the function of government in a way that can actually scale by strengthening civil society
ted_01381_0602680_0612130 and there &apos;s a generation out there that &apos;s grown up on the internet and they know that it &apos;s not that hard to do things together you just have to architect the systems the right way
ted_01381_0614010_0625630 now the average age of our fellows is 28 so i am begrudgingly almost a generation older than most of them this is a generation that &apos;s grown up taking their voices pretty much for granted
ted_01381_0626740_0632280 they &apos;re not fighting that battle that we &apos;re all fighting about who gets to speak they all get to speak
ted_01381_0632810_0637270 they can express their opinion on any channel at any time and they do
ted_01381_0638140_0644440 so when they &apos;re faced with the problem of government they don &apos;t care as much about using their voices
ted_01381_0645500_0646750 they &apos;re using their hands
ted_01381_0647940_0651180 they &apos;re using their hands to write applications that make government work better
ted_01381_0652110_0656870 and those applications let us use our hands to make our communities better
ted_01381_0658110_0663920 that could be shoveling out a hydrant pulling a weed turning over a garbage can with an opossum in it
ted_01381_0665430_0670370 and certainly we could have been shoveling out those fire hydrants all along and many people do
ted_01381_0670950_0680210 but these apps are like little digital reminders that we &apos;re not just consumers and we &apos;re not just consumers of government putting in our taxes and getting back services
ted_01381_0681160_0683540 we &apos;re more than that we &apos;re citizens
ted_01381_0684220_0689060 and we &apos;re not going to fix government until we fix citizenship
ted_01381_0690720_0707150 so the question i have for all of you here when it comes to the big important things that we need to do together all of us together are we just going to be a crowd of voices or are we also going to be a crowd of hands
ted_01381_0708200_0708680 thank you
ted_01381_0721880_0722080 applause
ted_01404_0012980_0016210 this may sound strange but i &apos;m a big fan of the concrete block
ted_01404_0016710_0025660 the first concrete blocks were manufactured in 1868 with a very simple idea modules made of cement of a fixed measurement that fit together
ted_01404_0026680_0030860 very quickly concrete blocks became the mostused construction unit in the world
ted_01404_0031360_0036800 they enabled us to to build things that were larger than us buildings bridges one brick at a time
ted_01404_0037480_0040840 essentially concrete blocks had become the building block of our time
ted_01404_0042450_0046520 almost a hundred years later in 1947 lego came up with this
ted_01404_0047120_0048970 it was called the automatic binding brick
ted_01404_0049420_0053800 and in a few short years lego bricks took place in every household
ted_01404_0054060_0059610 it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion bricks have been produced or 75 bricks for every person on the planet
ted_01404_0060670_0065150 you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to make beautiful houses beautiful bridges beautiful buildings
ted_01404_0065380_0066770 lego made it accessible
ted_01404_0067240_0073390 lego has essentially taken the concrete block the building block of the world and made it into the building block of our imagination
ted_01404_0074610_0080640 meanwhile the exact same year at bell labs the next revolution was about to be announced the next building block
ted_01404_0081050_0089450 the transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of static bricks piled on top of each other to a world where everything was interactive
ted_01404_0090400_0096800 like the concrete block the transistor allows you to build much larger more complex circuits one brick at a time
ted_01404_0097030_0100710 but there &apos;s a main difference the transistor was only for experts
ted_01404_0101170_0107690 i personally don &apos;t accept this that the building block of our time is reserved for experts so i decided to change that
ted_01404_0109420_0116760 eight years ago when i was at the media lab i started exploring this idea of how to put the power of engineers in the hands of artists and designers
ted_01404_0117820_0120000 a few years ago i started developing littlebits
ted_01404_0120290_0121530 let me show you how they work
ted_01404_0124570_0129780 littlebits are electronic modules with each one specific function
ted_01404_0130560_0136840 they &apos;re preengineered to be light sound motors and sensors
ted_01404_0137450_0142770 and the best part about it is they snap together with magnets
ted_01404_0143120_0144830 so you can &apos;t put them the wrong way
ted_01404_0146220_0147630 the bricks are colorcoded
ted_01404_0147820_0152340 green is output blue is power pink is input and orange is wire
ted_01404_0152700_0159090 so all you need to do is snap a blue to a green and very quickly you can start making larger circuits
ted_01404_0159130_0161780 you put a blue to a green you can make light
ted_01404_0162420_0168370 you can put a knob in between and now you &apos;ve made a little dimmer
ted_01404_0170490_0179260 switch out the knob for a pulse module which is here and now you &apos;ve made a little blinker
ted_01404_0181740_0186720 add this buzzer for some extra punch and you &apos;ve created a noise machine
ted_01404_0188490_0189370 i &apos;m going to stop that
ted_01404_0189750_0194150 so beyond simple play littlebits are actually pretty powerful
ted_01404_0194670_0201210 instead of having to program to wire to solder littlebits allow you to program using very simple intuitive gestures
ted_01404_0201470_0207090 so to make this blink faster or slower you would just turn this knob and basically make it pulse faster or slower
ted_01404_0208700_0211650 the idea behind littlebits is that it &apos;s a growing library
ted_01404_0212310_0216270 we want to make every single interaction in the world into a readytouse brick
ted_01404_0216420_0220310 lights sounds solar panels motors everything should be accessible
ted_01404_0220760_0224070 we &apos;ve been giving littlebits to kids and seeing them play with them
ted_01404_0224090_0225660 and it &apos;s been an incredible experience
ted_01404_0225690_0231160 the nicest thing is how they start to understand the electronics around them from everyday that they don &apos;t learn at schools
ted_01404_0231360_0238120 for example how a nightlight works or why an elevator door stays open or how an ipod responds to touch
ted_01404_0239020_0241280 we &apos;ve also been taking littlebits to design schools
ted_01404_0241310_0247230 so for example we &apos;ve had designers with no experience with electronics whatsoever start to play with littlebits as a material
ted_01404_0248010_0252480 here you see with felt and paper water bottles we have geordie making
ted_01404_0258100_0258300 clanging
ted_01404_0258155_0258355 buzzing
ted_01404_0258280_0276840 a few weeks ago we took littlebits to risd and gave them to some designers with no experience in engineering whatsoever just cardboard wood and paper and told them make something here &apos;s an example of a project they made a motionactivated confetti canon ball laughter but wait this is actually my favorite project
ted_01404_0278190_0285150 it &apos;s a lobster made of playdough that &apos;s afraid of the dark
ted_01404_0289375_0289575 laughter
ted_01404_0289700_0294730 to these nonengineers littlebits became another material electronics became just another material
ted_01404_0294990_0297500 and we want to make this material accessible to everyone
ted_01404_0297750_0299040 so littlebits is opensource
ted_01404_0299060_0302430 you can go on the website download all the design files make them yourself
ted_01404_0302710_0310960 we want to encourage a world of creators of inventors of contributors because this world that we live in this interactive world is ours
ted_01404_0311220_0313280 so go ahead and start inventing
ted_01404_0313780_0314170 thank you
ted_01404_0318660_0318860 applause

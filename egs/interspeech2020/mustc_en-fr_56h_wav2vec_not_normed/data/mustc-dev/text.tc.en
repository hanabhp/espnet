ted_00767_0012750_0016260 I &apos;m going to talk today about energy and climate .
ted_00767_0017030_0031160 And that might seem a bit surprising , because my full-time work at the foundation is mostly about vaccines and seeds , about the things that we need to invent and deliver to help the poorest two billion live better lives .
ted_00767_0032400_0041270 But energy and climate are extremely important to these people ; in fact , more important than to anyone else on the planet .
ted_00767_0041730_0055970 The climate getting worse means that many years , their crops won &apos;t grow : there will be too much rain , not enough rain ; things will change in ways their fragile environment simply can &apos;t support .
ted_00767_0056460_0060160 And that leads to starvation , it leads to uncertainty , it leads to unrest .
ted_00767_0060830_0063820 So , the climate changes will be terrible for them .
ted_00767_0064740_0067610 Also , the price of energy is very important to them .
ted_00767_0067990_0074870 In fact , if you could pick just one thing to lower the price of to reduce poverty , by far you would pick energy .
ted_00767_0075650_0078410 Now , the price of energy has come down over time .
ted_00767_0079030_0085280 Really advanced civilization is based on advances in energy .
ted_00767_0085570_0101660 The coal revolution fueled the Industrial Revolution , and , even in the 1900s , we &apos;ve seen a very rapid decline in the price of electricity , and that &apos;s why we have refrigerators , air-conditioning ; we can make modern materials and do so many things .
ted_00767_0102150_0108270 And so , we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
ted_00767_0109190_0121580 But as we make it cheaper - and let &apos;s say , let &apos;s go for making it twice as cheap - we need to meet a new constraint , and that constraint has to do with CO2 .
ted_00767_0123410_0130720 CO2 is warming the planet , and the equation on CO2 is actually a very straightforward one .
ted_00767_0130960_0152870 If you sum up the CO2 that gets emitted , that leads to a temperature increase , and that temperature increase leads to some very negative effects : the effects on the weather ; perhaps worse , the indirect effects , in that the natural ecosystems can &apos;t adjust to these rapid changes , and so you get ecosystem collapses .
ted_00767_0153320_0164690 Now , the exact amount of how you map from a certain increase of CO2 to what temperature will be , and where the positive feedbacks are - there &apos;s some uncertainty there , but not very much .
ted_00767_0165180_0170080 And there &apos;s certainly uncertainty about how bad those effects will be , but they will be extremely bad .
ted_00767_0171160_0175970 I asked the top scientists on this several times : Do we really have to get down to near zero ?
ted_00767_0175990_0178740 Can &apos;t we just cut it in half or a quarter ?
ted_00767_0179060_0184980 And the answer is , until we get near to zero , the temperature will continue to rise .
ted_00767_0185350_0187070 And so that &apos;s a big challenge .
ted_00767_0187100_0198220 It &apos;s very different than saying , &quot; We &apos;re a twelve-foot-high truck trying to get under a ten-foot bridge , and we can just sort of squeeze under . &quot; This is something that has to get to zero .
ted_00767_0199510_0205070 Now , we put out a lot of carbon dioxide every year - over 26 billion tons .
ted_00767_0205670_0208560 For each American , it &apos;s about 20 tons .
ted_00767_0209270_0211590 For people in poor countries , it &apos;s less than one ton .
ted_00767_0211870_0215560 It &apos;s an average of about five tons for everyone on the planet .
ted_00767_0215980_0220640 And somehow , we have to make changes that will bring that down to zero .
ted_00767_0221540_0223440 It &apos;s been constantly going up .
ted_00767_0223730_0233250 It &apos;s only various economic changes that have even flattened it at all , so we have to go from rapidly rising to falling , and falling all the way to zero .
ted_00767_0233960_0237610 This equation has four factors , a little bit of multiplication .
ted_00767_0237970_0255290 So you &apos;ve got a thing on the left , CO2 , that you want to get to zero , and that &apos;s going to be based on the number of people , the services each person is using on average , the energy , on average , for each service , and the CO2 being put out per unit of energy .
ted_00767_0255630_0260440 So let &apos;s look at each one of these , and see how we can get this down to zero .
ted_00767_0261110_0264260 Probably , one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero .
ted_00767_0264920_0268920 ( Laughter ) That &apos;s back from high school algebra . But let &apos;s take a look .
ted_00767_0269930_0271540 First , we &apos;ve got population .
ted_00767_0272170_0274600 The world today has 6.8 billion people .
ted_00767_0274910_0276610 That &apos;s headed up to about nine billion .
ted_00767_0277130_0289100 Now , if we do a really great job on new vaccines , health care , reproductive health services , we could lower that by , perhaps , 10 or 15 percent . But there , we see an increase of about 1.3 .
ted_00767_0291340_0293980 The second factor is the services we use .
ted_00767_0294390_0300280 This encompasses everything : the food we eat , clothing , TV , heating .
ted_00767_0300680_0308320 These are very good things . Getting rid of poverty means providing these services to almost everyone on the planet .
ted_00767_0308390_0311710 And it &apos;s a great thing for this number to go up .
ted_00767_0311990_0326310 In the rich world , perhaps the top one billion , we probably could cut back and use less , but every year , this number , on average , is going to go up , and so , overall , that will more than double the services delivered per person .
ted_00767_0327040_0331990 Here we have a very basic service : Do you have lighting in your house to be able to read your homework ?
ted_00767_0332000_0337480 And , in fact , these kids don &apos;t , so they &apos;re going out and reading their schoolwork under the street lamps .
ted_00767_0339200_0344670 Now , efficiency , &quot; E , &quot; the energy for each service - here , finally we have some good news .
ted_00767_0344680_0346200 We have something that &apos;s not going up .
ted_00767_0346620_0361540 Through various inventions and new ways of doing lighting , through different types of cars , different ways of building buildings - there are a lot of services where you can bring the energy for that service down quite substantially .
ted_00767_0361780_0365170 Some individual services even bring it down by 90 percent .
ted_00767_0365460_0373410 There are other services , like how we make fertilizer , or how we do air transport , where the rooms for improvement are far , far less .
ted_00767_0373840_0383020 And so overall , if we &apos;re optimistic , we may get a reduction of a factor of three to even , perhaps , a factor of six .
ted_00767_0383530_0392340 But for these first three factors now , we &apos;ve gone from 26 billion to , at best , maybe 13 billion tons , and that just won &apos;t cut it .
ted_00767_0392860_0402590 So let &apos;s look at this fourth factor - this is going to be a key one - and this is the amount of CO2 put out per each unit of energy .
ted_00767_0403220_0409040 So the question is : Can you actually get that to zero ? If you burn coal , no .
ted_00767_0409410_0410620 If you burn natural gas , no .
ted_00767_0410620_0419250 Almost every way we make electricity today , except for the emerging renewables and nuclear , puts out CO2 .
ted_00767_0420160_0425330 And so , what we &apos;re going to have to do at a global scale , is create a new system .
ted_00767_0425880_0427600 So we need energy miracles .
ted_00767_0428440_0431520 Now , when I use the term &quot; miracle , &quot; I don &apos;t mean something that &apos;s impossible .
ted_00767_0432140_0434950 The microprocessor is a miracle .
ted_00767_0435080_0436760 The personal computer is a miracle .
ted_00767_0437400_0439440 The Internet and its services are a miracle .
ted_00767_0439630_0444330 So the people here have participated in the creation of many miracles .
ted_00767_0444760_0448940 Usually , we don &apos;t have a deadline where you have to get the miracle by a certain date .
ted_00767_0448960_0453000 Usually , you just kind of stand by , and some come along , some don &apos;t .
ted_00767_0453290_0461250 This is a case where we actually have to drive at full speed and get a miracle in a pretty tight timeline .
ted_00767_0462430_0465290 Now , I thought , &quot; How could I really capture this ?
ted_00767_0465300_0478520 Is there some kind of natural illustration , some demonstration that would grab people &apos;s imagination here ? &quot; I thought back to a year ago when I brought mosquitoes , and somehow people enjoyed that .
ted_00767_0479230_0485540 ( Laughter ) It really got them involved in the idea of , you know , there are people who live with mosquitoes .
ted_00767_0485540_0489910 With energy , all I could come up with is this .
ted_00767_0490770_0497520 I decided that releasing fireflies would be my contribution to the environment here this year .
ted_00767_0497880_0500470 So here we have some natural fireflies .
ted_00767_0500790_0505190 I &apos;m told they don &apos;t bite ; in fact , they might not even leave that jar . ( Laughter )
ted_00767_0507760_0513540 Now , there &apos;s all sorts of gimmicky solutions like that one , but they don &apos;t really add up to much .
ted_00767_0513840_0531160 We need solutions , either one or several , that have unbelievable scale and unbelievable reliability . And although there &apos;s many directions that people are seeking , I really only see five that can achieve the big numbers .
ted_00767_0531510_0540080 I &apos;ve left out tide , geothermal , fusion , biofuels . Those may make some contribution , and if they can do better than I expect , so much the better .
ted_00767_0540570_0553240 But my key point here is that we &apos;re going to have to work on each of these five , and we can &apos;t give up any of them because they look daunting , because they all have significant challenges .
ted_00767_0553750_0559320 Let &apos;s look first at burning fossil fuels , either burning coal or burning natural gas .
ted_00767_0559690_0573270 What you need to do there seems like it might be simple , but it &apos;s not . And that &apos;s to take all the CO2 , after you &apos;ve burned it , going out the flue , pressurize it , create a liquid , put it somewhere , and hope it stays there .
ted_00767_0574120_0591930 Now , we have some pilot things that do this at the 60 to 80 percent level . But getting up to that full percentage - that will be very tricky . And agreeing on where these CO2 quantities should be put will be hard , but the toughest one here is this long-term issue : Who &apos;s going to be sure ?
ted_00767_0592130_0601230 Who &apos;s going to guarantee something that is literally billions of times larger than any type of waste you think of in terms of nuclear or other things ?
ted_00767_0601230_0603580 This is a lot of volume .
ted_00767_0604450_0605560 So that &apos;s a tough one .
ted_00767_0606170_0625030 Next would be nuclear . It also has three big problems : cost , particularly in highly regulated countries , is high ; the issue of safety , really feeling good about nothing could go wrong , that , even though you have these human operators , the fuel doesn &apos;t get used for weapons .
ted_00767_0625390_0627190 And then what do you do with the waste ?
ted_00767_0627310_0630700 Although it &apos;s not very large , there are a lot of concerns about that .
ted_00767_0630700_0632030 People need to feel good about it .
ted_00767_0632290_0638420 So three very tough problems that might be solvable , and so , should be worked on .
ted_00767_0639100_0641380 The last three of the five , I &apos;ve grouped together .
ted_00767_0642010_0645350 These are what people often refer to as the renewable sources .
ted_00767_0645760_0651820 And they actually - although it &apos;s great they don &apos;t require fuel - they have some disadvantages .
ted_00767_0652240_0660180 One is that the density of energy gathered in these technologies is dramatically less than a power plant .
ted_00767_0660190_0668480 This is energy farming , so you &apos;re talking about many square miles , thousands of times more area than you think of as a normal energy plant .
ted_00767_0669430_0671500 Also , these are intermittent sources .
ted_00767_0671970_0677610 The sun doesn &apos;t shine all day , it doesn &apos;t shine every day , and likewise , the wind doesn &apos;t blow all the time .
ted_00767_0677960_0685640 And so , if you depend on these sources , you have to have some way of getting the energy during those time periods that it &apos;s not available .
ted_00767_0686060_0688580 So we &apos;ve got big cost challenges here .
ted_00767_0689360_0700810 We have transmission challenges ; for example , say this energy source is outside your country , you not only need the technology , but you have to deal with the risk of the energy coming from elsewhere .
ted_00767_0701180_0703170 And , finally , this storage problem .
ted_00767_0703710_0725080 To dimensionalize this , I went through and looked at all the types of batteries made - for cars , for computers , for phones , for flashlights , for everything - and compared that to the amount of electrical energy the world uses . What I found is that all the batteries we make now could store less than 10 minutes of all the energy .
ted_00767_0725910_0734710 And so , in fact , we need a big breakthrough here , something that &apos;s going to be a factor of 100 better than the approaches we have now .
ted_00767_0736100_0738800 It &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not a very easy thing .
ted_00767_0739260_0747000 Now , this shows up when you try to get the intermittent source to be above , say , 20 to 30 percent of what you &apos;re using .
ted_00767_0747070_0753370 If you &apos;re counting on it for 100 percent , you need an incredible miracle battery .
ted_00767_0754980_0758480 Now , how are we going to go forward on this - what &apos;s the right approach ?
ted_00767_0758480_0759860 Is it a Manhattan Project ?
ted_00767_0759860_0761690 What &apos;s the thing that can get us there ?
ted_00767_0762120_0766960 Well , we need lots of companies working on this - hundreds .
ted_00767_0767010_0770270 In each of these five paths , we need at least a hundred people .
ted_00767_0770600_0780770 A lot of them , you &apos;ll look at and say , &quot; They &apos;re crazy . &quot; That &apos;s good . And , I think , here in the TED group , we have many people who are already pursuing this .
ted_00767_0781470_0786970 Bill Gross has several companies , including one called eSolar that has some great solar thermal technologies .
ted_00767_0786970_0796890 Vinod Khosla is investing in dozens of companies that are doing great things and have interesting possibilities , and I &apos;m trying to help back that .
ted_00767_0797380_0804200 Nathan Myhrvold and I actually are backing a company that , perhaps surprisingly , is actually taking the nuclear approach .
ted_00767_0804670_0808530 There are some innovations in nuclear : modular , liquid .
ted_00767_0809840_0817960 Innovation really stopped in this industry quite some ago , so the idea that there &apos;s some good ideas laying around is not all that surprising .
ted_00767_0818440_0833510 The idea of TerraPower is that , instead of burning a part of uranium - the one percent , which is the U235 - we decided , &quot; Let &apos;s burn the 99 percent , the U238 . &quot; It is kind of a crazy idea .
ted_00767_0834120_0851670 In fact , people had talked about it for a long time , but they could never simulate properly whether it would work or not , and so it &apos;s through the advent of modern supercomputers that now you can simulate and see that , yes , with the right materials approach , this looks like it would work .
ted_00767_0852050_0859240 And because you &apos;re burning that 99 percent , you have greatly improved cost profile .
ted_00767_0859260_0866460 You actually burn up the waste , and you can actually use as fuel all the leftover waste from today &apos;s reactors .
ted_00767_0866530_0870050 So instead of worrying about them , you just take that , it &apos;s a great thing .
ted_00767_0870760_0875000 It breeds this uranium as it goes along , so it &apos;s kind of like a candle .
ted_00767_0875000_0878840 You see it &apos;s a log there , often referred to as a traveling wave reactor .
ted_00767_0879370_0883000 In terms of fuel , this really solves the problem .
ted_00767_0883320_0886050 I &apos;ve got a picture here of a place in Kentucky .
ted_00767_0886280_0891940 This is the leftover , the 99 percent , where they &apos;ve taken out the part they burn now , so it &apos;s called depleted uranium .
ted_00767_0892190_0894950 That would power the US for hundreds of years .
ted_00767_0895230_0902490 And simply by filtering seawater in an inexpensive process , you &apos;d have enough fuel for the entire lifetime of the rest of the planet .
ted_00767_0902900_0914170 So , you know , it &apos;s got lots of challenges ahead , but it is an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to move forward .
ted_00767_0915300_0917960 So let &apos;s think : How should we measure ourselves ?
ted_00767_0917960_0920950 What should our report card look like ?
ted_00767_0921270_0925840 Well , let &apos;s go out to where we really need to get , and then look at the intermediate .
ted_00767_0925960_0931240 For 2050 , you &apos;ve heard many people talk about this 80 percent reduction .
ted_00767_0931760_0934510 That really is very important , that we get there .
ted_00767_0934840_0943970 And that 20 percent will be used up by things going on in poor countries - still some agriculture ; hopefully , we will have cleaned up forestry , cement .
ted_00767_0944720_0956530 So , to get to that 80 percent , the developed countries , including countries like China , will have had to switch their electricity generation altogether .
ted_00767_0957460_0967810 The other grade is : Are we deploying this zero-emission technology , have we deployed it in all the developed countries and are in the process of getting it elsewhere ?
ted_00767_0968150_0969510 That &apos;s super important .
ted_00767_0969790_0973210 That &apos;s a key element of making that report card .
ted_00767_0974090_0978110 Backing up from there , what should the 2020 report card look like ?
ted_00767_0978670_0980900 Well , again , it should have the two elements .
ted_00767_0981120_0990040 We should go through these efficiency measures to start getting reductions : The less we emit , the less that sum will be of CO2 , and therefore , the less the temperature .
ted_00767_0990550_1005370 But in some ways , the grade we get there , doing things that don &apos;t get us all the way to the big reductions , is only equally , or maybe even slightly less , important than the other , which is the piece of innovation on these breakthroughs .
ted_00767_1005410_1014010 These breakthroughs , we need to move those at full speed , and we can measure that in terms of companies , pilot projects , regulatory things that have been changed .
ted_00767_1014530_1017060 There &apos;s a lot of great books that have been written about this .
ted_00767_1017290_1030430 The Al Gore book , &quot; Our Choice , &quot; and the David MacKay book , &quot; Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air . &quot; They really go through it and create a framework that this can be discussed broadly , because we need broad backing for this .
ted_00767_1031040_1032820 There &apos;s a lot that has to come together .
ted_00767_1033170_1034210 So this is a wish .
ted_00767_1034630_1038990 It &apos;s a very concrete wish that we invent this technology .
ted_00767_1039300_1054170 If you gave me only one wish for the next 50 years - I could pick who &apos;s president , I could pick a vaccine , which is something I love , or I could pick that this thing that &apos;s half the cost with no CO2 gets invented - this is the wish I would pick .
ted_00767_1054680_1056450 This is the one with the greatest impact .
ted_00767_1056800_1070320 If we don &apos;t get this wish , the division between the people who think short term and long term will be terrible , between the US and China , between poor countries and rich , and most of all , the lives of those two billion will be far worse .
ted_00767_1071070_1072120 So what do we have to do ?
ted_00767_1072410_1077770 What am I appealing to you to step forward and drive ?
ted_00767_1078090_1080760 We need to go for more research funding .
ted_00767_1081170_1085510 When countries get together in places like Copenhagen , they shouldn &apos;t just discuss the CO2 .
ted_00767_1086190_1094700 They should discuss this innovation agenda . You &apos;d be stunned at the ridiculously low levels of spending on these innovative approaches .
ted_00767_1095090_1101390 We do need the market incentives - CO2 tax , cap and trade - something that gets that price signal out there .
ted_00767_1101800_1103070 We need to get the message out .
ted_00767_1103070_1109380 We need to have this dialogue be a more rational , more understandable dialogue , including the steps that the government takes .
ted_00767_1110080_1113590 This is an important wish , but it is one I think we can achieve .
ted_00767_1114380_1129670 Thank you . ( Applause ) ( Applause ends )
ted_00767_1129840_1136680 Thank you . Chris Anderson : Thank you . Thank you .
ted_00767_1137730_1141870 ( Applause ) CA : Thank you . So to understand more about TerraPower .
ted_00767_1141870_1146300 I mean , first of all , can you give a sense of what scale of investment this is ?
ted_00767_1146790_1174750 Bill Gates : To actually do the software , buy the supercomputer , hire all the great scientists , which we &apos;ve done , that &apos;s only tens of millions . And even once we test our materials out in a Russian reactor to make sure our materials work properly , then you &apos;ll only be up in the hundreds of millions . The tough thing is building the pilot reactor - finding the several billion , finding the regulator , the location that will actually build the first one of these .
ted_00767_1174870_1185070 Once you get the first one built , if it works as advertised , then it &apos;s just clear as day , because the economics , the energy density , are so different than nuclear as we know it .
ted_00767_1185360_1197790 CA : So to understand it right , this involves building deep into the ground , almost like a vertical column of nuclear fuel , of this spent uranium , and then the process starts at the top and kind of works down ?
ted_00767_1197800_1198220 BG : That &apos;s right .
ted_00767_1198220_1208980 Today , you &apos;re always refueling the reactor , so you have lots of people and lots of controls that can go wrong , where you &apos;re opening it up and moving things in and out - that &apos;s not good .
ted_00767_1209140_1210340 So if you have very -
ted_00767_1210900_1219160 ( Laughter ) very cheap fuel that you can put 60 years in - just think of it as a log - put it down and not have those same complexities .
ted_00767_1219430_1224020 And it just sits there and burns for the 60 years , and then it &apos;s done .
ted_00767_1224570_1228240 CA : It &apos;s a nuclear power plant that is its own waste disposal solution .
ted_00767_1228250_1239550 BG : Yeah ; what happens with the waste , you can let it sit there - there &apos;s a lot less waste under this approach - then you can actually take that and put it into another one and burn that .
ted_00767_1240390_1250520 And we start out , actually , by taking the waste that exists today that &apos;s sitting in these cooling pools or dry-casking by reactors - that &apos;s our fuel to begin with .
ted_00767_1250520_1259950 So the thing that &apos;s been a problem from those reactors is actually what gets fed into ours , and you &apos;re reducing the volume of the waste quite dramatically as you &apos;re going through this process .
ted_00767_1260350_1267070 CA : You &apos;re talking to different people around the world about the possibilities . Where is there most interest in actually doing something with this ?
ted_00767_1267430_1283450 BG : Well , we haven &apos;t picked a particular place , and there &apos;s all these interesting disclosure rules about anything that &apos;s called &quot; nuclear . &quot; So we &apos;ve got a lot of interest . People from the company have been in Russia , India , China .
ted_00767_1283730_1293310 I &apos;ve been back seeing the secretary of energy here , talking about how this fits into the energy agenda . So I &apos;m optimistic . The French and Japanese have done some work .
ted_00767_1293530_1297100 This is a variant on something that has been done .
ted_00767_1297100_1307460 It &apos;s an important advance , but it &apos;s like a fast reactor , and a lot of countries have built them , so anybody who &apos;s done a fast reactor is a candidate to be where the first one gets built .
ted_00767_1308480_1315180 CA : So , in your mind , timescale and likelihood of actually taking something like this live ?
ted_00767_1315190_1327000 BG : Well , we need - for one of these high-scale , electro-generation things that &apos;s very cheap , we have 20 years to invent and then 20 years to deploy .
ted_00767_1327020_1333840 That &apos;s sort of the deadline that the environmental models have shown us that we have to meet .
ted_00767_1334190_1340900 And TerraPower - if things go well , which is wishing for a lot - could easily meet that .
ted_00767_1341330_1352930 And there are , fortunately now , dozens of companies - we need it to be hundreds - who , likewise , if their science goes well , if the funding for their pilot plants goes well , that they can compete for this .
ted_00767_1353220_1357680 And it &apos;s best if multiple succeed , because then you could use a mix of these things .
ted_00767_1357680_1359480 We certainly need one to succeed .
ted_00767_1360150_1365140 CA : In terms of big-scale possible game changers , is this the biggest that you &apos;re aware of out there ?
ted_00767_1365910_1370100 BG : An energy breakthrough is the most important thing .
ted_00767_1370120_1376730 It would have been , even without the environmental constraint , but the environmental constraint just makes it so much greater .
ted_00767_1377060_1379400 In the nuclear space , there are other innovators .
ted_00767_1380330_1386560 You know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as we know this one , but the modular people , that &apos;s a different approach .
ted_00767_1386660_1391480 There &apos;s a liquid-type reactor , which seems a little hard , but maybe they say that about us .
ted_00767_1392630_1416250 And so , there are different ones , but the beauty of this is a molecule of uranium has a million times as much energy as a molecule of , say , coal . And so , if you can deal with the negatives , which are essentially the radiation , the footprint and cost , the potential , in terms of effect on land and various things , is almost in a class of its own .
ted_00767_1416870_1421280 CA : If this doesn &apos;t work , then what ?
ted_00767_1421610_1427340 Do we have to start taking emergency measures to try and keep the temperature of the earth stable ?
ted_00767_1428010_1434810 BG : If you get into that situation , it &apos;s like if you &apos;ve been overeating , and you &apos;re about to have a heart attack .
ted_00767_1435150_1437250 Then where do you go ?
ted_00767_1437250_1438990 You may need heart surgery or something .
ted_00767_1439310_1449320 There is a line of research on what &apos;s called geoengineering , which are various techniques that would delay the heating to buy us 20 or 30 years to get our act together .
ted_00767_1449650_1452920 Now , that &apos;s just an insurance policy ; you hope you don &apos;t need to do that .
ted_00767_1453160_1461300 Some people say you shouldn &apos;t even work on the insurance policy because it might make you lazy , that you &apos;ll keep eating because you know heart surgery will be there to save you .
ted_00767_1461520_1475650 I &apos;m not sure that &apos;s wise , given the importance of the problem , but there &apos;s now the geoengineering discussion about : Should that be in the back pocket in case things happen faster , or this innovation goes a lot slower than we expect ?
ted_00767_1475660_1486100 CA : Climate skeptics : If you had a sentence or two to say to them , how might you persuade them that they &apos;re wrong ?
ted_00767_1486110_1489910 BG : Well , unfortunately , the skeptics come in different camps .
ted_00767_1489970_1494820 The ones who make scientific arguments are very few .
ted_00767_1495620_1500050 Are they saying there &apos;s negative feedback effects that have to do with clouds that offset things ?
ted_00767_1500050_1506260 There are very , very few things that they can even say there &apos;s a chance in a million of those things .
ted_00767_1506340_1512910 The main problem we have here - it &apos;s kind of like with AIDS : you make the mistake now , and you pay for it a lot later .
ted_00767_1513390_1522930 And so , when you have all sorts of urgent problems , the idea of taking pain now that has to do with a gain later , and a somewhat uncertain pain thing .
ted_00767_1522930_1539020 In fact , the IPCC report - that &apos;s not necessarily the worst case , and there are people in the rich world who look at IPCC and say , &quot; OK , that isn &apos;t that big of a deal . &quot; The fact is it &apos;s that uncertain part that should move us towards this .
ted_00767_1539240_1558910 But my dream here is that , if you can make it economic , and meet the CO2 constraints , then the skeptics say , &quot; OK , I don &apos;t care that it doesn &apos;t put out CO2 , I kind of wish it did put out CO2 . But I guess I &apos;ll accept it , because it &apos;s cheaper than what &apos;s come before . &quot; ( Applause )
ted_00767_1558910_1576320 CA : So that would be your response to the Bjørn Lomborg argument , basically if you spend all this energy trying to solve the CO2 problem , it &apos;s going to take away all your other goals of trying to rid the world of poverty and malaria and so forth , it &apos;s a stupid waste of the Earth &apos;s resources to put money towards that when there are better things we can do .
ted_00767_1576330_1585700 BG : Well , the actual spending on the R &amp; amp ; D piece - say the US should spend 10 billion a year more than it is right now - it &apos;s not that dramatic .
ted_00767_1585700_1587290 It shouldn &apos;t take away from other things .
ted_00767_1587360_1597100 The thing you get into big money on , and reasonable people can disagree , is when you have something that &apos;s non-economic and you &apos;re trying to fund that - that , to me , mostly is a waste .
ted_00767_1597100_1607520 Unless you &apos;re very close , and you &apos;re just funding the learning curve and it &apos;s going to get very cheap , I believe we should try more things that have a potential to be far less expensive .
ted_00767_1607830_1615110 If the trade-off you get into is , &quot; Let &apos;s make energy super expensive , &quot; then the rich can afford that .
ted_00767_1615120_1621830 I mean , all of us here could pay five times as much for our energy and not change our lifestyle . The disaster is for that two billion .
ted_00767_1622020_1638810 And even Lomborg has changed . His shtick now is , &quot; Why isn &apos;t the R &amp; amp ; D getting more discussed ? &quot; He &apos;s still , because of his earlier stuff , still associated with the skeptic camp , but he &apos;s realized that &apos;s a pretty lonely camp , and so , he &apos;s making the R &amp; amp ; D point .
ted_00767_1639050_1643690 And so there is a thread of something that I think is appropriate .
ted_00767_1643730_1646450 The R &amp; amp ; D piece - it &apos;s crazy how little it &apos;s funded .
ted_00767_1646450_1652980 CA : Well , Bill , I suspect I speak on behalf of most people here to say I really hope your wish comes true . Thank you so much .
ted_00767_1652990_1653650 BG : Thank you . ( Applause )
ted_00769_0014590_0021600 I &apos;d like to share with you a discovery that I made a few months ago while writing an article for Italian Wired .
ted_00769_0022260_0034230 I always keep my thesaurus handy whenever I &apos;m writing anything , but I &apos;d already finished editing the piece , and I realized that I had never once in my life looked up the word &quot; disabled &quot; to see what I &apos;d find .
ted_00769_0034950_0076340 Let me read you the entry . &quot; Disabled , adjective : crippled , helpless , useless , wrecked , stalled , maimed , wounded , mangled , lame , mutilated , run-down , worn-out , weakened , impotent , castrated , paralyzed , handicapped , senile , decrepit , laid-up , done-up , done-for , done-in cracked-up , counted-out ; see also hurt , useless and weak .
ted_00769_0077080_0105790 Antonyms , healthy , strong , capable . &quot; I was reading this list out loud to a friend and at first was laughing , it was so ludicrous , but I &apos;d just gotten past &quot; mangled , &quot; and my voice broke , and I had to stop and collect myself from the emotional shock and impact that the assault from these words unleashed .
ted_00769_0107090_0112890 You know , of course , this is my raggedy old thesaurus so I &apos;m thinking this must be an ancient print date , right ?
ted_00769_0113340_0127150 But , in fact , the print date was the early 1980s , when I would have been starting primary school and forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit and as related to the other kids and the world around me .
ted_00769_0127170_0131460 And , needless to say , thank God I wasn &apos;t using a thesaurus back then .
ted_00769_0132790_0152100 I mean , from this entry , it would seem that I was born into a world that perceived someone like me to have nothing positive whatsoever going for them , when in fact , today I &apos;m celebrated for the opportunities and adventures my life has procured .
ted_00769_0153140_0161490 So , I immediately went to look up the 2009 online edition , expecting to find a revision worth noting .
ted_00769_0162510_0164440 Here &apos;s the updated version of this entry .
ted_00769_0165860_0169090 Unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
ted_00769_0169520_0177110 I find the last two words under &quot; Near Antonyms , &quot; particularly unsettling : &quot; whole &quot; and &quot; wholesome . &quot;
ted_00769_0179060_0181090 So , it &apos;s not just about the words .
ted_00769_0181560_0185520 It &apos;s what we believe about people when we name them with these words .
ted_00769_0185970_0189750 It &apos;s about the values behind the words , and how we construct those values .
ted_00769_0190690_0197140 Our language affects our thinking and how we view the world and how we view other people .
ted_00769_0197780_0210700 In fact , many ancient societies , including the Greeks and the Romans , believed that to utter a curse verbally was so powerful , because to say the thing out loud brought it into existence .
ted_00769_0212200_0221450 So , what reality do we want to call into existence : a person who is limited , or a person who &apos;s empowered ?
ted_00769_0222680_0235100 By casually doing something as simple as naming a person , a child , we might be putting lids and casting shadows on their power .
ted_00769_0235920_0238870 Wouldn &apos;t we want to open doors for them instead ?
ted_00769_0239880_0247130 One such person who opened doors for me was my childhood doctor at the A.I. duPont Institute in Wilmington , Delaware .
ted_00769_0247860_0265320 His name was Dr. Pizzutillo , an Italian American , whose name , apparently , was too difficult for most Americans to pronounce , so he went by Dr. P. And Dr. P always wore really colorful bow ties and had the very perfect disposition to work with children .
ted_00769_0266730_0275190 I loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital , with the exception of my physical therapy sessions .
ted_00769_0275980_0301070 I had to do what seemed like innumerable repetitions of exercises with these thick , elastic bands - different colors , you know - to help build up my leg muscles , and I hated these bands more than anything - I hated them , had names for them . I hated them . And , you know , I was already bargaining , as a five year-old child , with Dr. P to try to get out of doing these exercises , unsuccessfully , of course .
ted_00769_0301970_0312260 And , one day , he came in to my session - exhaustive and unforgiving , these sessions - and he said to me , &quot; Wow .
ted_00769_0312930_0319230 Aimee , you are such a strong and powerful little girl , I think you &apos;re going to break one of those bands .
ted_00769_0319970_0322560 When you do break it , I &apos;m going to give you a hundred bucks . &quot;
ted_00769_0323340_0345710 Now , of course , this was a simple ploy on Dr. P &apos;s part to get me to do the exercises I didn &apos;t want to do before the prospect of being the richest five-year-old in the second floor ward , but what he effectively did for me was reshape an awful daily occurrence into a new and promising experience for me .
ted_00769_0346680_0364190 And I have to wonder today to what extent his vision and his declaration of me as a strong and powerful little girl shaped my own view of myself as an inherently strong , powerful and athletic person well into the future .
ted_00769_0365010_0371280 This is an example of how adults in positions of power can ignite the power of a child .
ted_00769_0372100_0387630 But , in the previous instances of those thesaurus entries , our language isn &apos;t allowing us to evolve into the reality that we would all want , the possibility of an individual to see themselves as capable .
ted_00769_0389020_0396060 Our language hasn &apos;t caught up with the changes in our society , many of which have been brought about by technology .
ted_00769_0396920_0428420 Certainly , from a medical standpoint , my legs , laser surgery for vision impairment , titanium knees and hip replacements for aging bodies that are allowing people to more fully engage with their abilities , and move beyond the limits that nature has imposed on them - not to mention social networking platforms allow people to self-identify , to claim their own descriptions of themselves , so they can go align with global groups of their own choosing .
ted_00769_0429910_0448820 So , perhaps technology is revealing more clearly to us now what has always been a truth : that everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society , and that the human ability to adapt is our greatest asset .
ted_00769_0450230_0470800 The human ability to adapt , it &apos;s an interesting thing , because people have continually wanted to talk to me about overcoming adversity , and I &apos;m going to make an admission : This phrase never sat right with me , and I always felt uneasy trying to answer people &apos;s questions about it , and I think I &apos;m starting to figure out why .
ted_00769_0472180_0498890 Implicit in this phrase of &quot; overcoming adversity &quot; is the idea that success , or happiness , is about emerging on the other side of a challenging experience unscathed or unmarked by the experience , as if my successes in life have come about from an ability to sidestep or circumnavigate the presumed pitfalls of a life with prosthetics , or what other people perceive as my disability .
ted_00769_0499970_0502170 But , in fact , we are changed .
ted_00769_0502350_0508900 We are marked , of course , by a challenge , whether physically , emotionally or both .
ted_00769_0508900_0511230 And I &apos;m going to suggest that this is a good thing .
ted_00769_0512460_0518120 Adversity isn &apos;t an obstacle that we need to get around in order to resume living our life .
ted_00769_0519010_0520410 It &apos;s part of our life .
ted_00769_0521890_0524270 And I tend to think of it like my shadow .
ted_00769_0525110_0529500 Sometimes I see a lot of it , sometimes there &apos;s very little , but it &apos;s always with me .
ted_00769_0530390_0536530 And , certainly , I &apos;m not trying to diminish the impact , the weight , of a person &apos;s struggle .
ted_00769_0537160_0548380 There is adversity and challenge in life , and it &apos;s all very real and relative to every single person , but the question isn &apos;t whether or not you &apos;re going to meet adversity , but how you &apos;re going to meet it .
ted_00769_0549390_0559090 So , our responsibility is not simply shielding those we care for from adversity , but preparing them to meet it well .
ted_00769_0560110_0569660 And we do a disservice to our kids when we make them feel that they &apos;re not equipped to adapt .
ted_00769_0571230_0583930 There &apos;s an important difference and distinction between the objective medical fact of my being an amputee and the subjective societal opinion of whether or not I &apos;m disabled .
ted_00769_0584850_0595100 And , truthfully , the only real and consistent disability I &apos;ve had to confront is the world ever thinking that I could be described by those definitions .
ted_00769_0596650_0614350 In our desire to protect those we care about by giving them the cold , hard truth about their medical prognosis , or , indeed , a prognosis on the expected quality of their life , we have to make sure that we don &apos;t put the first brick in a wall that will actually disable someone .
ted_00769_0615950_0626920 Perhaps the existing model of only looking at what is broken in you and how do we fix it , serves to be more disabling to the individual than the pathology itself .
ted_00769_0628090_0640570 By not treating the wholeness of a person , by not acknowledging their potency , we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have .
ted_00769_0641670_0647740 We are effectively grading someone &apos;s worth to our community .
ted_00769_0648250_0655320 So we need to see through the pathology and into the range of human capability .
ted_00769_0656870_0665610 And , most importantly , there &apos;s a partnership between those perceived deficiencies and our greatest creative ability .
ted_00769_0666380_0679400 So it &apos;s not about devaluing , or negating , these more trying times as something we want to avoid or sweep under the rug , but instead to find those opportunities wrapped in the adversity .
ted_00769_0680710_0700400 So maybe the idea I want to put out there is not so much overcoming adversity as it is opening ourselves up to it , embracing it , grappling with it , to use a wrestling term , maybe even dancing with it .
ted_00769_0702480_0712780 And , perhaps , if we see adversity as natural , consistent and useful , we &apos;re less burdened by the presence of it .
ted_00769_0714380_0725540 This year we celebrate the 200th birthday of Charles Darwin , and it was 150 years ago , when writing about evolution , that Darwin illustrated , I think , a truth about the human character .
ted_00769_0725990_0737020 To paraphrase : It &apos;s not the strongest of the species that survives , nor is it the most intelligent that survives ; it is the one that is most adaptable to change .
ted_00769_0738500_0741280 Conflict is the genesis of creation .
ted_00769_0742780_0757520 From Darwin &apos;s work , amongst others , we can recognize that the human ability to survive and flourish is driven by the struggle of the human spirit through conflict into transformation .
ted_00769_0757970_0763660 So , again , transformation , adaptation , is our greatest human skill .
ted_00769_0765690_0770230 And , perhaps , until we &apos;re tested , we don &apos;t know what we &apos;re made of .
ted_00769_0771040_0775690 Maybe that &apos;s what adversity gives us : a sense of self , a sense of our own power .
ted_00769_0777410_0780200 So , we can give ourselves a gift .
ted_00769_0780750_0786470 We can re-imagine adversity as something more than just tough times .
ted_00769_0787250_0788800 Maybe we can see it as change .
ted_00769_0789720_0794260 Adversity is just change that we haven &apos;t adapted ourselves to yet .
ted_00769_0795870_0800710 I think the greatest adversity that we &apos;ve created for ourselves is this idea of normalcy .
ted_00769_0801670_0802650 Now , who &apos;s normal ?
ted_00769_0804440_0805480 There &apos;s no normal .
ted_00769_0806060_0808110 There &apos;s common , there &apos;s typical .
ted_00769_0808730_0814600 There &apos;s no normal , and would you want to meet that poor , beige person if they existed ? ( Laughter ) I don &apos;t think so .
ted_00769_0816010_0836600 If we can change this paradigm from one of achieving normalcy to one of possibility - or potency , to be even a little bit more dangerous - we can release the power of so many more children , and invite them to engage their rare and valuable abilities with the community .
ted_00769_0837500_0845280 Anthropologists tell us that the one thing we as humans have always required of our community members is to be of use , to be able to contribute .
ted_00769_0847290_0871540 There &apos;s evidence that Neanderthals , 60,000 years ago , carried their elderly and those with serious physical injury , and perhaps it &apos;s because the life experience of survival of these people proved of value to the community . They didn &apos;t view these people as broken and useless ; they were seen as rare and valuable .
ted_00769_0871540_0881410 A few years ago , I was in a food market in the town where I grew up in that red zone in northeastern Pennsylvania , and I was standing over a bushel of tomatoes .
ted_00769_0881900_0883670 It was summertime : I had shorts on .
ted_00769_0884260_0890970 I hear this guy , his voice behind me say , &quot; Well , if it isn &apos;t Aimee Mullins . &quot; And I turn around , and it &apos;s this older man .
ted_00769_0890970_0892040 I have no idea who he is .
ted_00769_0892760_0896590 And I said , &quot; I &apos;m sorry , sir , have we met ?
ted_00769_0896590_0898610 I don &apos;t remember meeting you . &quot;
ted_00769_0899020_0901100 He said , &quot; Well , you wouldn &apos;t remember meeting me .
ted_00769_0901170_0906800 I mean , when we met I was delivering you from your mother &apos;s womb . &quot; ( Laughter ) Oh , that guy .
ted_00769_0909060_0911260 And , but of course , actually , it did click .
ted_00769_0911560_0923780 This man was Dr. Kean , a man that I had only known about through my mother &apos;s stories of that day , because , of course , typical fashion , I arrived late for my birthday by two weeks .
ted_00769_0924100_0931850 And so my mother &apos;s prenatal physician had gone on vacation , so the man who delivered me was a complete stranger to my parents .
ted_00769_0932820_0943450 And , because I was born without the fibula bones , and had feet turned in , and a few toes in this foot and a few toes in that , he had to be the bearer - this stranger had to be the bearer of bad news .
ted_00769_0944160_0966730 He said to me , &quot; I had to give this prognosis to your parents that you would never walk , and you would never have the kind of mobility that other kids have or any kind of life of independence , and you &apos;ve been making liar out of me ever since . &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause )
ted_00769_0967130_0993240 The extraordinary thing is that he said he had saved newspaper clippings throughout my whole childhood , whether winning a second grade spelling bee , marching with the Girl Scouts , you know , the Halloween parade , winning my college scholarship , or any of my sports victories , and he was using it , and integrating it into teaching resident students , med students from Hahnemann Medical School and Hershey Medical School .
ted_00769_0993750_0999100 And he called this part of the course the X Factor , the potential of the human will .
ted_00769_1000340_1027900 No prognosis can account for how powerful this could be as a determinant in the quality of someone &apos;s life . And Dr. Kean went on to tell me , he said , &quot; In my experience , unless repeatedly told otherwise , and even if given a modicum of support , if left to their own devices , a child will achieve . &quot;
ted_00769_1029070_1032050 See , Dr. Kean made that shift in thinking .
ted_00769_1032820_1037970 He understood that there &apos;s a difference between the medical condition and what someone might do with it .
ted_00769_1039520_1051850 And there &apos;s been a shift in my thinking over time , in that , if you had asked me at 15 years old , if I would have traded prosthetics for flesh-and-bone legs , I wouldn &apos;t have hesitated for a second .
ted_00769_1053120_1057380 I aspired to that kind of normalcy back then .
ted_00769_1058540_1061570 But if you ask me today , I &apos;m not so sure .
ted_00769_1062640_1071700 And it &apos;s because of the experiences I &apos;ve had with them , not in spite of the experiences I &apos;ve had with them .
ted_00769_1073140_1086770 And perhaps this shift in me has happened because I &apos;ve been exposed to more people who have opened doors for me than those who have put lids and cast shadows on me .
ted_00769_1088010_1093690 See , all you really need is one person to show you the epiphany of your own power , and you &apos;re off .
ted_00769_1094800_1108130 If you can hand somebody the key to their own power - the human spirit is so receptive - if you can do that and open a door for someone at a crucial moment , you are educating them in the best sense .
ted_00769_1110100_1112660 You &apos;re teaching them to open doors for themselves .
ted_00769_1113230_1130060 In fact , the exact meaning of the word &quot; educate &quot; comes from the root word &quot; educe . &quot; It means &quot; to bring forth what is within , to bring out potential . &quot; So again , which potential do we want to bring out ?
ted_00769_1132310_1140130 There was a case study done in 1960s Britain , when they were moving from grammar schools to comprehensive schools .
ted_00769_1140130_1141240 It &apos;s called the streaming trials .
ted_00769_1141240_1143450 We call it &quot; tracking &quot; here in the States .
ted_00769_1143460_1165850 It &apos;s separating students from A , B , C , D and so on . And the &quot; A students &quot; get the tougher curriculum , the best teachers , etc . Well , they took , over a three-month period , D-level students , gave them A &apos;s , told them they were &quot; A &apos;s , &quot; told them they were bright , and at the end of this three-month period , they were performing at A-level .
ted_00769_1166550_1176980 And , of course , the heartbreaking , flip side of this study , is that they took the &quot; A students &quot; and told them they were &quot; D &apos;s . &quot; And that &apos;s what happened at the end of that three-month period .
ted_00769_1177010_1180550 Those who were still around in school , besides the people who had dropped out .
ted_00769_1184700_1190640 A crucial part of this case study was that the teachers were duped too .
ted_00769_1192110_1193920 The teachers didn &apos;t know a switch had been made .
ted_00769_1194260_1201650 They were simply told , &quot; These are the &apos; A-students , &apos; these are the &apos; D-students . &apos; &quot; And that &apos;s how they went about teaching them and treating them .
ted_00769_1204280_1227530 So , I think that the only true disability is a crushed spirit , a spirit that &apos;s been crushed doesn &apos;t have hope , it doesn &apos;t see beauty , it no longer has our natural , childlike curiosity and our innate ability to imagine .
ted_00769_1229580_1243960 If instead , we can bolster a human spirit to keep hope , to see beauty in themselves and others , to be curious and imaginative , then we are truly using our power well .
ted_00769_1245350_1252910 When a spirit has those qualities , we are able to create new realities and new ways of being .
ted_00769_1254140_1292190 I &apos;d like to leave you with a poem by a fourteenth-century Persian poet named Hafiz that my friend , Jacques Dembois told me about , and the poem is called &quot; The God Who Only Knows Four Words &quot; : &quot; Every child has known God , not the God of names , not the God of don &apos;ts , but the God who only knows four words and keeps repeating them , saying , &apos; Come dance with me . Come , dance with me . Come , dance with me . &apos; &quot;
ted_00769_1292600_1296650 Thank you . ( Applause )
ted_00779_0012940_0014950 Everybody talks about happiness these days .
ted_00779_0016200_0025750 I had somebody count the number of books with &quot; happiness &quot; in the title published in the last five years and they gave up after about 40 , and there were many more .
ted_00779_0026610_0031100 There is a huge wave of interest in happiness , among researchers .
ted_00779_0031570_0033200 There is a lot of happiness coaching .
ted_00779_0033200_0035310 Everybody would like to make people happier .
ted_00779_0036880_0045310 But in spite of all this flood of work , there are several cognitive traps that sort of make it almost impossible to think straight about happiness .
ted_00779_0045430_0049130 And my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive traps .
ted_00779_0049580_0058690 This applies to laypeople thinking about their own happiness , and it applies to scholars thinking about happiness , because it turns out we &apos;re just as messed up as anybody else is .
ted_00779_0060250_0063710 The first of these traps is a reluctance to admit complexity .
ted_00779_0063720_0073000 It turns out that the word &quot; happiness &quot; is just not a useful word anymore , because we apply it to too many different things .
ted_00779_0073120_0085180 I think there is one particular meaning to which we might restrict it , but by and large , this is something that we &apos;ll have to give up and we &apos;ll have to adopt the more complicated view of what well-being is .
ted_00779_0086210_0096260 The second trap is a confusion between experience and memory ; basically , it &apos;s between being happy in your life , and being happy about your life or happy with your life .
ted_00779_0096290_0101520 And those are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both lumped in the notion of happiness .
ted_00779_0102000_0112440 And the third is the focusing illusion , and it &apos;s the unfortunate fact that we can &apos;t think about any circumstance that affects well-being without distorting its importance .
ted_00779_0112480_0114450 I mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
ted_00779_0114650_0116350 There &apos;s just no way of getting it right .
ted_00779_0117990_0140170 Now , I &apos;d like to start with an example of somebody who had a question-and-answer session after one of my lectures reported a story , and that was a story - He said he &apos;d been listening to a symphony , and it was absolutely glorious music and at the very end of the recording , there was a dreadful screeching sound .
ted_00779_0140940_0152120 And then he added , really quite emotionally , it ruined the whole experience . But it hadn &apos;t . What it had ruined were the memories of the experience .
ted_00779_0152120_0153680 He had had the experience .
ted_00779_0153680_0156210 He had had 20 minutes of glorious music .
ted_00779_0156510_0164350 They counted for nothing because he was left with a memory ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was all that he had gotten to keep .
ted_00779_0165420_0172210 What this is telling us , really , is that we might be thinking of ourselves and of other people in terms of two selves .
ted_00779_0173430_0183970 There is an experiencing self , who lives in the present and knows the present , is capable of re-living the past , but basically it has only the present .
ted_00779_0184570_0213600 It &apos;s the experiencing self that the doctor approaches - you know , when the doctor asks , &quot; Does it hurt now when I touch you here ? &quot; And then there is a remembering self , and the remembering self is the one that keeps score , and maintains the story of our life , and it &apos;s the one that the doctor approaches in asking the question , &quot; How have you been feeling lately ? &quot; or &quot; How was your trip to Albania ? &quot; or something like that .
ted_00779_0213860_0224800 Those are two very different entities , the experiencing self and the remembering self , and getting confused between them is part of the mess about the notion of happiness .
ted_00779_0226370_0231470 Now , the remembering self is a storyteller .
ted_00779_0231980_0237270 And that really starts with a basic response of our memories - it starts immediately .
ted_00779_0237290_0240990 We don &apos;t only tell stories when we set out to tell stories .
ted_00779_0241260_0247620 Our memory tells us stories , that is , what we get to keep from our experiences is a story .
ted_00779_0248150_0251050 And let me begin with one example .
ted_00779_0252500_0254540 This is an old study .
ted_00779_0254660_0257640 Those are actual patients undergoing a painful procedure .
ted_00779_0257640_0258740 I won &apos;t go into detail .
ted_00779_0258910_0264850 It &apos;s no longer painful these days , but it was painful when this study was run in the 1990s .
ted_00779_0265480_0268120 They were asked to report on their pain every 60 seconds .
ted_00779_0269220_0272360 Here are two patients , those are their recordings .
ted_00779_0272680_0277420 And you are asked , &quot; Who of them suffered more ? &quot; And it &apos;s a very easy question .
ted_00779_0277680_0287180 Clearly , Patient B suffered more - his colonoscopy was longer , and every minute of pain that Patient A had , Patient B had , and more .
ted_00779_0287840_0295080 But now there is another question : &quot; How much did these patients think they suffered ? &quot; And here is a surprise .
ted_00779_0295650_0320850 The surprise is that Patient A had a much worse memory of the colonoscopy than Patient B. The stories of the colonoscopies were different , and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends . And neither of these stories is very inspiring or great - but one of them is this distinct ... ( Laughter ) but one of them is distinctly worse than the other .
ted_00779_0321480_0328540 And the one that is worse is the one where pain was at its peak at the very end ; it &apos;s a bad story .
ted_00779_0328620_0340980 How do we know that ? Because we asked these people after their colonoscopy , and much later , too , &quot; How bad was the whole thing , in total ? &quot; And it was much worse for A than for B , in memory .
ted_00779_0341360_0345760 Now this is a direct conflict between the experiencing self and the remembering self .
ted_00779_0346210_0351020 From the point of view of the experiencing self , clearly , B had a worse time .
ted_00779_0351730_0375010 Now , what you could do with Patient A , and we actually ran clinical experiments , and it has been done , and it does work - you could actually extend the colonoscopy of Patient A by just keeping the tube in without jiggling it too much . That will cause the patient to suffer , but just a little and much less than before .
ted_00779_0375050_0392410 And if you do that for a couple of minutes , you have made the experiencing self of Patient A worse off , and you have the remembering self of Patient A a lot better off , because now you have endowed Patient A with a better story about his experience .
ted_00779_0393600_0395700 What defines a story ?
ted_00779_0396500_0403010 And that is true of the stories that memory delivers for us , and it &apos;s also true of the stories that we make up .
ted_00779_0403720_0409430 What defines a story are changes , significant moments and endings .
ted_00779_0409670_0414360 Endings are very , very important and , in this case , the ending dominated .
ted_00779_0415910_0421280 Now , the experiencing self lives its life continuously .
ted_00779_0421290_0424030 It has moments of experience , one after the other .
ted_00779_0424530_0431000 And you can ask : What happens to these moments ? And the answer is really straightforward : They are lost forever .
ted_00779_0431010_0447610 I mean , most of the moments of our life - and I calculated , you know , the psychological present is said to be about three seconds long ; that means that , you know , in a life there are about 600 million of them ; in a month , there are about 600,000 - most of them don &apos;t leave a trace .
ted_00779_0447610_0451700 Most of them are completely ignored by the remembering self .
ted_00779_0452860_0461520 And yet , somehow you get the sense that they should count , that what happens during these moments of experience is our life .
ted_00779_0461890_0466000 It &apos;s the finite resource that we &apos;re spending while we &apos;re on this earth .
ted_00779_0466590_0474050 And how to spend it would seem to be relevant , but that is not the story that the remembering self keeps for us .
ted_00779_0474460_0479850 So we have the remembering self and the experiencing self , and they &apos;re really quite distinct .
ted_00779_0480280_0483860 The biggest difference between them is in the handling of time .
ted_00779_0485290_0498450 From the point of view of the experiencing self , if you have a vacation , and the second week is just as good as the first , then the two-week vacation is twice as good as the one-week vacation .
ted_00779_0498720_0501670 That &apos;s not the way it works at all for the remembering self .
ted_00779_0501990_0508780 For the remembering self , a two-week vacation is barely better than the one-week vacation because there are no new memories added .
ted_00779_0509020_0511030 You have not changed the story .
ted_00779_0511660_0524840 And in this way , time is actually the critical variable that distinguishes a remembering self from an experiencing self ; time has very little impact on the story .
ted_00779_0526760_0530950 Now , the remembering self does more than remember and tell stories .
ted_00779_0531010_0552190 It is actually the one that makes decisions because , if you have a patient who has had , say , two colonoscopies with two different surgeons and is deciding which of them to choose , then the one that chooses is the one that has the memory that is less bad , and that &apos;s the surgeon that will be chosen .
ted_00779_0552640_0556780 The experiencing self has no voice in this choice .
ted_00779_0557220_0562790 We actually don &apos;t choose between experiences , we choose between memories of experiences .
ted_00779_0563170_0569470 And even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t think of our future normally as experiences .
ted_00779_0569560_0573030 We think of our future as anticipated memories .
ted_00779_0573970_0586910 And basically you can look at this , you know , as a tyranny of the remembering self , and you can think of the remembering self sort of dragging the experiencing self through experiences that the experiencing self doesn &apos;t need .
ted_00779_0587310_0599850 I have that sense that when we go on vacations this is very frequently the case ; that is , we go on vacations , to a very large extent , in the service of our remembering self .
ted_00779_0600750_0603090 And this is a bit hard to justify I think .
ted_00779_0603100_0606380 I mean , how much do we consume our memories ?
ted_00779_0606620_0624080 That is one of the explanations that is given for the dominance of the remembering self . And when I think about that , I think about a vacation we had in Antarctica a few years ago , which was clearly the best vacation I &apos;ve ever had , and I think of it relatively often , relative to how much I think of other vacations .
ted_00779_0624550_0632910 And I probably have consumed my memories of that three-week trip , I would say , for about 25 minutes in the last four years .
ted_00779_0633660_0640360 Now , if I had ever opened the folder with the 600 pictures in it , I would have spent another hour .
ted_00779_0641130_0665070 Now , that is three weeks , and that is at most an hour and a half . There seems to be a discrepancy . Now , I may be a bit extreme , you know , in how little appetite I have for consuming memories , but even if you do more of this , there is a genuine question : Why do we put so much weight on memory relative to the weight that we put on experiences ?
ted_00779_0665410_0669070 So I want you to think about a thought experiment .
ted_00779_0670000_0681140 Imagine that for your next vacation , you know that at the end of the vacation all your pictures will be destroyed , and you &apos;ll get an amnesic drug so that you won &apos;t remember anything .
ted_00779_0681900_0709620 Now , would you choose the same vacation ? ( Laughter ) And if you would choose a different vacation , there is a conflict between your two selves , and you need to think about how to adjudicate that conflict , and it &apos;s actually not at all obvious , because if you think in terms of time , then you get one answer , and if you think in terms of memories , you might get another answer .
ted_00779_0709950_0717610 Why do we pick the vacations we do is a problem that confronts us with a choice between the two selves .
ted_00779_0718380_0723650 Now , the two selves bring up two notions of happiness .
ted_00779_0723690_0727890 There are really two concepts of happiness that we can apply , one per self .
ted_00779_0729540_0732670 So you can ask : How happy is the experiencing self ?
ted_00779_0733130_0737480 And then you would ask : How happy are the moments in the experiencing self &apos;s life ?
ted_00779_0737870_0742200 And they &apos;re all - happiness for moments is a fairly complicated process .
ted_00779_0742200_0744810 What are the emotions that can be measured ?
ted_00779_0744980_0753330 And , by the way , now we are capable of getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experiencing self over time .
ted_00779_0755270_0759790 If you ask for the happiness of the remembering self , it &apos;s a completely different thing .
ted_00779_0759800_0762690 This is not about how happily a person lives .
ted_00779_0763000_0785410 It is about how satisfied or pleased the person is when that person thinks about her life . Very different notion . Anyone who doesn &apos;t distinguish those notions is going to mess up the study of happiness , and I belong to a crowd of students of well-being , who &apos;ve been messing up the study of happiness for a long time in precisely this way .
ted_00779_0786010_0798380 The distinction between the happiness of the experiencing self and the satisfaction of the remembering self has been recognized in recent years , and there are now efforts to measure the two separately .
ted_00779_0798380_0812350 The Gallup Organization has a world poll where more than half a million people have been asked questions about what they think of their life and about their experiences , and there have been other efforts along those lines .
ted_00779_0812670_0817210 So in recent years , we have begun to learn about the happiness of the two selves .
ted_00779_0817810_0823080 And the main lesson I think that we have learned is they are really different .
ted_00779_0823590_0834070 You can know how satisfied somebody is with their life , and that really doesn &apos;t teach you much about how happily they &apos;re living their life , and vice versa .
ted_00779_0835250_0838800 Just to give you a sense of the correlation , the correlation is about .5 .
ted_00779_0839160_0847750 What that means is if you met somebody , and you were told , &quot; Oh his father is six feet tall , &quot; how much would you know about his height ?
ted_00779_0847960_0851660 Well , you would know something about his height , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
ted_00779_0851910_0853700 You have that much uncertainty .
ted_00779_0853880_0863390 If I tell you that somebody ranked their life eight on a scale of ten , you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy they are with their experiencing self .
ted_00779_0864020_0865590 So the correlation is low .
ted_00779_0865950_0870810 We know something about what controls satisfaction of the happiness self .
ted_00779_0870920_0874330 We know that money is very important , goals are very important .
ted_00779_0875120_0884710 We know that happiness is mainly being satisfied with people that we like , spending time with people that we like .
ted_00779_0884930_0887410 There are other pleasures , but this is dominant .
ted_00779_0887440_0893320 So if you want to maximize the happiness of the two selves , you are going to end up doing very different things .
ted_00779_0894010_0901930 The bottom line of what I &apos;ve said here is that we really should not think of happiness as a substitute for well-being .
ted_00779_0901990_0904280 It is a completely different notion .
ted_00779_0905760_0921720 Now , very quickly , another reason we cannot think straight about happiness is that we do not attend to the same things when we think about life , and we actually live .
ted_00779_0922250_0930070 So , if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in California , you are not going to get to the correct answer .
ted_00779_0930070_0951950 When you ask that question , you think people must be happier in California if , say , you live in Ohio . ( Laughter ) And what happens is when you think about living in California , you are thinking of the contrast between California and other places , and that contrast , say , is in climate .
ted_00779_0952010_0961890 Well , it turns out that climate is not very important to the experiencing self and it &apos;s not even very important to the reflective self that decides how happy people are .
ted_00779_0963060_0971020 But now , because the reflective self is in charge , you may end up - some people may end up moving to California .
ted_00779_0971140_0977030 And it &apos;s sort of interesting to trace what is going to happen to people who move to California in the hope of getting happier .
ted_00779_0977450_0997720 Well , their experiencing self is not going to get happier . We know that . But one thing will happen : They will think they are happier , because , when they think about it , they &apos;ll be reminded of how horrible the weather was in Ohio , and they will feel they made the right decision .
ted_00779_0998200_1006810 It is very difficult to think straight about well-being , and I hope I have given you a sense of how difficult it is .
ted_00779_1007040_1012560 Thank you .
ted_00779_1012485_1012685 ( Applause )
ted_00779_1012610_1017160 Chris Anderson : Thank you . I &apos;ve got a question for you .
ted_00779_1017160_1027000 Thank you so much . Now , when we were on the phone a few weeks ago , you mentioned to me that there was quite an interesting result came out of that Gallup survey .
ted_00779_1027680_1030710 Is that something you can share since you do have a few moments left now ?
ted_00779_1030960_1039210 Daniel Kahneman : Sure . I think the most interesting result that we found in the Gallup survey is a number , which we absolutely did not expect to find .
ted_00779_1039520_1043150 We found that with respect to the happiness of the experiencing self .
ted_00779_1046310_1050120 When we looked at how feelings , vary with income .
ted_00779_1051080_1064470 And it turns out that , below an income of 60,000 dollars a year , for Americans - and that &apos;s a very large sample of Americans , like 600,000 , so it &apos;s a large representative sample - below an income of 600,000 dollars a year ...
ted_00779_1064470_1064870 CA : 60,000 .
ted_00779_1064870_1074610 DK : 60,000 . ( Laughter ) 60,000 dollars a year , people are unhappy , and they get progressively unhappier the poorer they get .
ted_00779_1074610_1077660 Above that , we get an absolutely flat line .
ted_00779_1077690_1080600 I mean I &apos;ve rarely seen lines so flat .
ted_00779_1080600_1091820 Clearly , what is happening is money does not buy you experiential happiness , but lack of money certainly buys you misery , and we can measure that misery very , very clearly .
ted_00779_1091830_1097990 In terms of the other self , the remembering self , you get a different story .
ted_00779_1097990_1100700 The more money you earn , the more satisfied you are .
ted_00779_1100920_1102330 That does not hold for emotions .
ted_00779_1102940_1108520 CA : But Danny , the whole American endeavor is about life , liberty , the pursuit of happiness .
ted_00779_1108700_1119890 If people took seriously that finding , I mean , it seems to turn upside down everything we believe about , like for example , taxation policy and so forth .
ted_00779_1119890_1128020 Is there any chance that politicians , that the country generally , would take a finding like that seriously and run public policy based on it ?
ted_00779_1128020_1132790 DK : You know I think that there is recognition of the role of happiness research in public policy .
ted_00779_1132790_1141610 The recognition is going to be slow in the United States , no question about that , but in the U.K. , it is happening , and in other countries it is happening .
ted_00779_1141610_1147980 People are recognizing that they ought to be thinking of happiness when they think of public policy .
ted_00779_1147980_1160290 It &apos;s going to take a while , and people are going to debate whether they want to study experience happiness , or whether they want to study life evaluation , so we need to have that debate fairly soon .
ted_00779_1160290_1169080 How to enhance happiness goes very different ways depending on how you think , and whether you think of the remembering self or you think of the experiencing self .
ted_00779_1169080_1172930 This is going to influence policy , I think , in years to come .
ted_00779_1172930_1177530 In the United States , efforts are being made to measure the experience happiness of the population .
ted_00779_1177530_1182550 This is going to be , I think , within the next decade or two , part of national statistics .
ted_00779_1182550_1191510 CA : Well , it seems to me that this issue will - or at least should be - the most interesting policy discussion to track over the next few years .
ted_00779_1191510_1193970 Thank you so much for inventing behavioral economics . Thank you , Danny Kahneman .
ted_00783_0012790_0031600 If I can leave you with one big idea today , it &apos;s that the whole of the data in which we consume is greater that the sum of the parts , and instead of thinking about information overload , what I &apos;d like you to think about is how we can use information so that patterns pop and we can see trends that would otherwise be invisible .
ted_00783_0031870_0036250 So what we &apos;re looking at right here is a typical mortality chart organized by age .
ted_00783_0036750_0039500 This tool that I &apos;m using here is a little experiment .
ted_00783_0039500_0045750 It &apos;s called Pivot , and with Pivot what I can do is I can choose to filter in one particular cause of deaths - say , accidents .
ted_00783_0046080_0048950 And , right away , I see there &apos;s a different pattern that emerges .
ted_00783_0049350_0054210 This is because , in the mid-area here , people are at their most active , and over here they &apos;re at their most frail .
ted_00783_0054750_0065150 We can step back out again and then reorganize the data by cause of death , seeing that circulatory diseases and cancer are the usual suspects , but not for everyone .
ted_00783_0065390_0074490 If we go ahead and we filter by age - say 40 years or less - we see that accidents are actually the greatest cause that people have to be worried about .
ted_00783_0074790_0077310 And if you drill into that , it &apos;s especially the case for men .
ted_00783_0077980_0087850 So you get the idea that viewing information , viewing data in this way , is a lot like swimming in a living information info-graphic .
ted_00783_0088360_0092500 And if we can do this for raw data , why not do it for content as well ?
ted_00783_0092730_0101760 So what we have right here is the cover of every single Sports Illustrated ever produced . It &apos;s all here ; it &apos;s all on the web .
ted_00783_0102000_0104420 You can go back to your rooms and try this after my talk .
ted_00783_0105170_0107810 With Pivot , you can drill into a decade .
ted_00783_0107870_0110180 You can drill into a particular year .
ted_00783_0110370_0112520 You can jump right into a specific issue .
ted_00783_0112850_0116860 So I &apos;m looking at this ; I see the athletes that have appeared in this issue , the sports .
ted_00783_0116930_0123920 I &apos;m a Lance Armstrong fan , so I &apos;ll go ahead and I &apos;ll click on that , which reveals , for me , all the issues in which Lance Armstrong &apos;s been a part of .
ted_00783_0123910_0124110 ( Applause )
ted_00783_0127620_0136500 Now , if I want to just kind of take a peek at these , I might think , &quot; Well , what about taking a look at all of cycling ? &quot; So I can step back , and expand on that .
ted_00783_0136680_0137970 And I see Greg LeMond now .
ted_00783_0138450_0147500 And so you get the idea that when you navigate over information this way - going narrower , broader , backing in , backing out - you &apos;re not searching , you &apos;re not browsing .
ted_00783_0147500_0149670 You &apos;re doing something that &apos;s actually a little bit different .
ted_00783_0149850_0154530 It &apos;s in between , and we think it changes the way information can be used .
ted_00783_0154750_0158540 So I want to extrapolate on this idea a bit with something that &apos;s a little bit crazy .
ted_00783_0158880_0165110 What we &apos;re done here is we &apos;ve taken every single Wikipedia page and we reduced it down to a little summary .
ted_00783_0165340_0171250 So the summary consists of just a little synopsis and an icon to indicate the topical area that it comes from .
ted_00783_0171760_0176010 I &apos;m only showing the top 500 most popular Wikipedia pages right here .
ted_00783_0176150_0179460 But even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
ted_00783_0179640_0184250 Right away , we get a sense of what are the topical domains that are most popular on Wikipedia .
ted_00783_0184510_0186360 I &apos;m going to go ahead and select government .
ted_00783_0186760_0195510 Now , having selected government , I can now see that the Wikipedia categories that most frequently correspond to that are Time magazine People of the Year .
ted_00783_0195660_0202230 So this is really important because this is an insight that was not contained within any one Wikipedia page .
ted_00783_0202390_0206290 It &apos;s only possible to see that insight when you step back and look at all of them .
ted_00783_0206680_0215270 Looking at one of these particular summaries , I can then drill into the concept of Time magazine Person of the Year , bringing up all of them .
ted_00783_0215770_0236330 So looking at these people , I can see that the majority come from government ; some have come from natural sciences ; some , fewer still , have come from business - there &apos;s my boss - and one has come from music .
ted_00783_0237540_0241640 And interestingly enough , Bono is also a TED Prize winner .
ted_00783_0241780_0244700 So we can go , jump , and take a look at all the TED Prize winners .
ted_00783_0244750_0252980 So you see , we &apos;re navigating the web for the first time as if it &apos;s actually a web , not from page-to-page , but at a higher level of abstraction .
ted_00783_0253390_0258160 And so I want to show you one other thing that may catch you a little bit by surprise .
ted_00783_0258560_0261240 I &apos;m just showing the New York Times website here .
ted_00783_0261260_0273130 So Pivot , this application - I don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser , but you can view web pages with it - and we bring that zoomable technology to every single web page like this .
ted_00783_0273140_0277700 So I can step back , pop right back into a specific section .
ted_00783_0278350_0286660 Now the reason why this is important is because , by virtue of just viewing web pages in this way , I can look at my entire browsing history in the exact same way .
ted_00783_0286760_0290850 So I can drill into what I &apos;ve done over specific time frames .
ted_00783_0290900_0294650 Here , in fact , is the state of all the demo that I just gave .
ted_00783_0295020_0298150 And I can sort of replay some stuff that I was looking at earlier today .
ted_00783_0298770_0310030 And , if I want to step back and look at everything , I can slice and dice my history , perhaps by my search history - here , I was doing some nepotistic searching , looking for Bing , over here for Live Labs Pivot .
ted_00783_0310330_0313210 And from these , I can drill into the web page and just launch them again .
ted_00783_0313490_0320750 It &apos;s one metaphor repurposed multiple times , and in each case it makes the whole greater than the sum of the parts with the data .
ted_00783_0321230_0327260 So right now , in this world , we think about data as being this curse .
ted_00783_0327260_0329980 We talk about the curse of information overload .
ted_00783_0329980_0332370 We talk about drowning in data .
ted_00783_0332760_0346580 What if we can actually turn that upside down and turn the web upside down , so that instead of navigating from one thing to the next , we get used to the habit of being able to go from many things to many things , and then being able to see the patterns that were otherwise hidden ?
ted_00783_0347160_0354410 If we can do that , then instead of being trapped in data , we might actually extract information .
ted_00783_0354740_0357980 And , instead of dealing just with information , we can tease out knowledge .
ted_00783_0358210_0362290 And if we get the knowledge , then maybe even there &apos;s wisdom to be found .
ted_00783_0362590_0363640 So with that , I thank you .
ted_00783_0373275_0373475 ( Applause )
ted_00785_0013840_0016910 I grew up on a steady diet of science fiction .
ted_00785_0017520_0021860 In high school , I took a bus to school an hour each way every day .
ted_00785_0022340_0036680 And I was always absorbed in a book , science fiction book , which took my mind to other worlds , and satisfied , in a narrative form , this insatiable sense of curiosity that I had .
ted_00785_0037210_0054960 And you know , that curiosity also manifested itself in the fact that whenever I wasn &apos;t in school I was out in the woods , hiking and taking &quot; samples &quot; - frogs and snakes and bugs and pond water - and bringing it back , looking at it under the microscope .
ted_00785_0054980_0057390 You know , I was a real science geek .
ted_00785_0057400_0063550 But it was all about trying to understand the world , understand the limits of possibility .
ted_00785_0064050_0078090 And my love of science fiction actually seemed mirrored in the world around me , because what was happening , this was in the late &apos; 60s , we were going to the moon , we were exploring the deep oceans .
ted_00785_0078630_0089230 Jacques Cousteau was coming into our living rooms with his amazing specials that showed us animals and places and a wondrous world that we could never really have previously imagined .
ted_00785_0089230_0093020 So , that seemed to resonate with the whole science fiction part of it .
ted_00785_0093760_0110080 And I was an artist . I could draw . I could paint . And I found that because there weren &apos;t video games and this saturation of CG movies and all of this imagery in the media landscape , I had to create these images in my head .
ted_00785_0110140_0118750 You know , we all did , as kids having to read a book , and through the author &apos;s description , put something on the movie screen in our heads .
ted_00785_0119150_0126360 And so , my response to this was to paint , to draw alien creatures , alien worlds , robots , spaceships , all that stuff .
ted_00785_0126360_0131630 I was endlessly getting busted in math class doodling behind the textbook .
ted_00785_0131640_0138250 That was - the creativity had to find its outlet somehow .
ted_00785_0138820_0147060 And an interesting thing happened : The Jacques Cousteau shows actually got me very excited about the fact that there was an alien world right here on Earth .
ted_00785_0147060_0154210 I might not really go to an alien world on a spaceship someday - that seemed pretty darn unlikely .
ted_00785_0154770_0163060 But that was a world I could really go to , right here on Earth , that was as rich and exotic as anything that I had imagined from reading these books .
ted_00785_0163950_0168020 So , I decided I was going to become a scuba diver at the age of 15 .
ted_00785_0168470_0176380 And the only problem with that was that I lived in a little village in Canada , 600 miles from the nearest ocean . But I didn &apos;t let that daunt me .
ted_00785_0176700_0184250 I pestered my father until he finally found a scuba class in Buffalo , New York , right across the border from where we live .
ted_00785_0184690_0190330 And I actually got certified in a pool at a YMCA in the dead of winter in Buffalo , New York .
ted_00785_0190650_0197460 And I didn &apos;t see the ocean , a real ocean , for another two years , until we moved to California .
ted_00785_0198270_0209080 Since then , in the intervening 40 years , I &apos;ve spent about 3,000 hours underwater , and 500 hours of that was in submersibles .
ted_00785_0209080_0221760 And I &apos;ve learned that that deep-ocean environment , and even the shallow oceans , are so rich with amazing life that really is beyond our imagination .
ted_00785_0222830_0229760 Nature &apos;s imagination is so boundless compared to our own meager human imagination .
ted_00785_0229840_0234870 I still , to this day , stand in absolute awe of what I see when I make these dives .
ted_00785_0235090_0239560 And my love affair with the ocean is ongoing , and just as strong as it ever was .
ted_00785_0240410_0245400 But when I chose a career as an adult , it was filmmaking .
ted_00785_0245770_0254640 And that seemed to be the best way to reconcile this urge I had to tell stories with my urges to create images .
ted_00785_0254810_0257460 And I was , as a kid , constantly drawing comic books , and so on .
ted_00785_0257700_0262260 So , filmmaking was the way to put pictures and stories together , and that made sense .
ted_00785_0262360_0274470 And of course the stories that I chose to tell were science fiction stories : &quot; Terminator , &quot; &quot; Aliens &quot; and &quot; The Abyss . &quot; And with &quot; The Abyss , &quot; I was putting together my love of underwater and diving with filmmaking .
ted_00785_0274470_0276680 So , you know , merging the two passions .
ted_00785_0277190_0295790 Something interesting came out of &quot; The Abyss , &quot; which was that to solve a specific narrative problem on that film , which was to create this kind of liquid water creature , we actually embraced computer generated animation , CG .
ted_00785_0297200_0306680 And this resulted in the first soft-surface character , CG animation that was ever in a movie .
ted_00785_0307290_0318450 And even though the film didn &apos;t make any money - barely broke even , I should say - I witnessed something amazing , which is that the audience , the global audience , was mesmerized by this apparent magic .
ted_00785_0318460_0323890 You know , it &apos;s Arthur Clarke &apos;s law that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic .
ted_00785_0324000_0326380 They were seeing something magical .
ted_00785_0327010_0329800 And so that got me very excited .
ted_00785_0329810_0337810 And I thought , &quot; Wow , this is something that needs to be embraced into the cinematic art . &quot; So , with &quot; Terminator 2 , &quot; which was my next film , we took that much farther .
ted_00785_0337810_0342160 Working with ILM , we created the liquid metal dude in that film .
ted_00785_0342240_0344930 The success hung in the balance on whether that effect would work .
ted_00785_0344930_0350950 And it did , and we created magic again , and we had the same result with an audience - although we did make a little more money on that one .
ted_00785_0352690_0365960 So , drawing a line through those two dots of experience came to , &quot; This is going to be a whole new world , &quot; this was a whole new world of creativity for film artists .
ted_00785_0366220_0377300 So , I started a company with Stan Winston , my good friend Stan Winston , who is the premier make-up and creature designer at that time , and it was called Digital Domain .
ted_00785_0377620_0387510 And the concept of the company was that we would leapfrog past the analog processes of optical printers and so on , and we would go right to digital production .
ted_00785_0387520_0390640 And we actually did that and it gave us a competitive advantage for a while .
ted_00785_0391210_0399260 But we found ourselves lagging in the mid &apos; 90s in the creature and character design stuff that we had actually founded the company to do .
ted_00785_0399900_0419310 So , I wrote this piece called &quot; Avatar , &quot; which was meant to absolutely push the envelope of visual effects , of CG effects , beyond , with realistic human emotive characters generated in CG , and the main characters would all be in CG , and the world would be in CG .
ted_00785_0419650_0428510 And the envelope pushed back , and I was told by the folks at my company that we weren &apos;t going to be able to do this for a while .
ted_00785_0428510_0454620 So , I shelved it , and I made this other movie about a big ship that sinks . ( Laughter ) You know , I went and pitched it to the studio as &quot; &apos; Romeo and Juliet &apos; on a ship : &quot; It &apos;s going to be this epic romance , passionate film . &quot; Secretly , what I wanted to do was I wanted to dive to the real wreck of &quot; Titanic . &quot; And that &apos;s why I made the movie . ( Applause ) And that &apos;s the truth .
ted_00785_0455060_0456260 Now , the studio didn &apos;t know that .
ted_00785_0456260_0457150 But I convinced them .
ted_00785_0457150_0459450 I said , &quot; We &apos;re going to dive to the wreck .
ted_00785_0459450_0460540 We &apos;re going to film it for real .
ted_00785_0460540_0462470 We &apos;ll be using it in the opening of the film .
ted_00785_0462810_0463570 It will be really important .
ted_00785_0463630_0468720 It will be a great marketing hook . &quot; And I talked them into funding an expedition . ( Laughter )
ted_00785_0468730_0473980 Sounds crazy . But this goes back to that theme about your imagination creating a reality .
ted_00785_0474070_0486110 Because we actually created a reality where six months later , I find myself in a Russian submersible two and a half miles down in the north Atlantic , looking at the real Titanic through a view port . Not a movie , not HD - for real . ( Applause )
ted_00785_0489260_0490630 Now , that blew my mind .
ted_00785_0490710_0494700 And it took a lot of preparation , we had to build cameras and lights and all kinds of things .
ted_00785_0494700_0501470 But , it struck me how much this dive , these deep dives , was like a space mission .
ted_00785_0501500_0505640 You know , where it was highly technical , and it required enormous planning .
ted_00785_0505680_0513550 You get in this capsule , you go down to this dark hostile environment where there is no hope of rescue if you can &apos;t get back by yourself .
ted_00785_0513970_0515770 And I thought like , &quot; Wow .
ted_00785_0515770_0518140 I &apos;m like , living in a science fiction movie .
ted_00785_0518380_0519510 This is really cool . &quot;
ted_00785_0519930_0523710 And so , I really got bitten by the bug of deep-ocean exploration .
ted_00785_0523710_0527000 Of course , the curiosity , the science component of it - it was everything .
ted_00785_0527000_0530160 It was adventure , it was curiosity , it was imagination .
ted_00785_0530160_0534580 And it was an experience that Hollywood couldn &apos;t give me .
ted_00785_0534940_0537880 Because , you know , I could imagine a creature and we could create a visual effect for it .
ted_00785_0537880_0540620 But I couldn &apos;t imagine what I was seeing out that window .
ted_00785_0540810_0557030 As we did some of our subsequent expeditions , I was seeing creatures at hydrothermal vents and sometimes things that I had never seen before , sometimes things that no one had seen before , that actually were not described by science at the time that we saw them and imaged them .
ted_00785_0557460_0561160 So , I was completely smitten by this , and had to do more .
ted_00785_0561670_0564340 And so , I actually made a kind of curious decision .
ted_00785_0564350_0578310 After the success of &quot; Titanic , &quot; I said , &quot; OK , I &apos;m going to park my day job as a Hollywood movie maker , and I &apos;m going to go be a full-time explorer for a while . &quot; And so , we started planning these expeditions .
ted_00785_0578310_0584900 And we wound up going to the Bismark , and exploring it with robotic vehicles .
ted_00785_0585070_0586550 We went back to the Titanic wreck .
ted_00785_0586890_0590490 We took little bots that we had created that spooled a fiber optic .
ted_00785_0590830_0597020 And the idea was to go in and do an interior survey of that ship , which had never been done .
ted_00785_0597020_0598340 Nobody had ever looked inside the wreck .
ted_00785_0598340_0601610 They didn &apos;t have the means to do it , so we created technology to do it .
ted_00785_0602120_0612980 So , you know , here I am now , on the deck of Titanic , sitting in a submersible , and looking out at planks that look much like this , where I knew that the band had played .
ted_00785_0613470_0618440 And I &apos;m flying a little robotic vehicle through the corridor of the ship .
ted_00785_0618920_0623560 When I say , &quot; I &apos;m operating it , &quot; but my mind is in the vehicle .
ted_00785_0624010_0628320 I felt like I was physically present inside the shipwreck of Titanic .
ted_00785_0628320_0643210 And it was the most surreal kind of deja vu experience I &apos;ve ever had , because I would know before I turned a corner what was going to be there before the lights of the vehicle actually revealed it , because I had walked the set for months when we were making the movie .
ted_00785_0643750_0649110 And the set was based as an exact replica on the blueprints of the ship .
ted_00785_0649110_0651900 So , it was this absolutely remarkable experience .
ted_00785_0651900_0665460 And it really made me realize that the telepresence experience - that you actually can have these robotic avatars , then your consciousness is injected into the vehicle , into this other form of existence .
ted_00785_0665480_0667240 It was really , really quite profound .
ted_00785_0667250_0684350 And it may be a little bit of a glimpse as to what might be happening some decades out as we start to have cyborg bodies for exploration or for other means in many sort of post-human futures that I can imagine , as a science fiction fan .
ted_00785_0685180_0702110 So , having done these expeditions , and really beginning to appreciate what was down there , such as at the deep ocean vents where we had these amazing , amazing animals - they &apos;re basically aliens right here on Earth .
ted_00785_0702460_0705090 They live in an environment of chemosynthesis .
ted_00785_0705120_0709300 They don &apos;t survive on sunlight-based system the way we do .
ted_00785_0709370_0716740 And so , you &apos;re seeing animals that are living next to a 500-degree-Centigrade water plumes . You think they can &apos;t possibly exist .
ted_00785_0717450_0725180 At the same time I was getting very interested in space science as well - again , it &apos;s the science fiction influence , as a kid .
ted_00785_0725790_0746400 And I wound up getting involved with the space community , really involved with NASA , sitting on the NASA advisory board , planning actual space missions , going to Russia , going through the pre-cosmonaut biomedical protocols , and all these sorts of things , to actually go and fly to the international space station with our 3D camera systems .
ted_00785_0746660_0747930 And this was fascinating .
ted_00785_0747930_0752230 But what I wound up doing was bringing space scientists with us into the deep .
ted_00785_0753080_0767550 And taking them down so that they had access - astrobiologists , planetary scientists , people who were interested in these extreme environments - taking them down to the vents , and letting them see , and take samples and test instruments , and so on .
ted_00785_0767550_0772320 So , here we were making documentary films , but actually doing science , and actually doing space science .
ted_00785_0772750_0780400 I &apos;d completely closed the loop between being the science fiction fan , you know , as a kid , and doing this stuff for real .
ted_00785_0781260_0787180 And you know , along the way in this journey of discovery , I learned a lot .
ted_00785_0787760_0789070 I learned a lot about science .
ted_00785_0789090_0792230 But I also learned a lot about leadership .
ted_00785_0792800_0797140 Now you think director has got to be a leader , leader of , captain of the ship , and all that sort of thing .
ted_00785_0797390_0802120 I didn &apos;t really learn about leadership until I did these expeditions .
ted_00785_0802360_0806820 Because I had to , at a certain point , say , &quot; What am I doing out here ?
ted_00785_0807020_0808040 Why am I doing this ?
ted_00785_0808860_0812680 What do I get out of it ? &quot; We don &apos;t make money at these damn shows .
ted_00785_0812900_0814000 We barely break even .
ted_00785_0814340_0815270 There is no fame in it .
ted_00785_0815290_0821390 People sort of think I went away between &quot; Titanic &quot; and &quot; Avatar &quot; and was buffing my nails someplace , sitting at the beach .
ted_00785_0821720_0825940 Made all these films , made all these documentary films for a very limited audience .
ted_00785_0825950_0828050 No fame , no glory , no money .
ted_00785_0828220_0828890 What are you doing ?
ted_00785_0828920_0845470 You &apos;re doing it for the task itself , for the challenge - and the ocean is the most challenging environment there is - for the thrill of discovery , and for that strange bond that happens when a small group of people form a tightly knit team .
ted_00785_0845500_0853940 Because we would do these things with 10 , 12 people , working for years at a time , sometimes at sea for two , three months at a time .
ted_00785_0854570_0865970 And in that bond , you realize that the most important thing is the respect that you have for them and that they have for you , that you &apos;ve done a task that you can &apos;t explain to someone else .
ted_00785_0866330_0878200 When you come back to the shore and you say , &quot; We had to do this , and the fiber optic , and the attentuation , and the this and the that , all the technology of it , and the difficulty , the human-performance aspects of working at sea , &quot; you can &apos;t explain it to people .
ted_00785_0878200_0884560 It &apos;s that thing that maybe cops have , or people in combat that have gone through something together and they know they can never explain it .
ted_00785_0885090_0886810 Creates a bond , creates a bond of respect .
ted_00785_0887220_0898950 So , when I came back to make my next movie , which was &quot; Avatar , &quot; I tried to apply that same principle of leadership , which is that you respect your team , and you earn their respect in return .
ted_00785_0898960_0900630 And it really changed the dynamic .
ted_00785_0901010_0916610 So , here I was again with a small team , in uncharted territory , doing &quot; Avatar , &quot; coming up with new technology that didn &apos;t exist before . Tremendously exciting . Tremendously challenging . And we became a family , over a four-and-half year period .
ted_00785_0916610_0918660 And it completely changed how I do movies .
ted_00785_0918660_0931710 So , people have commented on how , &quot; Well , you know , you brought back the ocean organisms and put them on the planet of Pandora . &quot; To me , it was more of a fundamental way of doing business , the process itself , that changed as a result of that .
ted_00785_0932350_0934570 So , what can we synthesize out of all this ?
ted_00785_0934570_0936350 You know , what are the lessons learned ?
ted_00785_0936990_0940330 Well , I think number one is curiosity .
ted_00785_0940950_0943040 It &apos;s the most powerful thing you own .
ted_00785_0944430_0950330 Imagination is a force that can actually manifest a reality .
ted_00785_0951700_0958710 And the respect of your team is more important than all the laurels in the world .
ted_00785_0959750_0969240 I have young filmmakers come up to me and say , &quot; Give me some advice for doing this . &quot; And I say , &quot; Don &apos;t put limitations on yourself .
ted_00785_0969930_0975360 Other people will do that for you - don &apos;t do it to yourself , don &apos;t bet against yourself , and take risks . &quot;
ted_00785_0976390_0987160 NASA has this phrase that they like : &quot; Failure is not an option . &quot; But failure has to be an option in art and in exploration , because it &apos;s a leap of faith .
ted_00785_0987490_0993280 And no important endeavor that required innovation was done without risk .
ted_00785_0993380_0995330 You have to be willing to take those risks .
ted_00785_0996210_1005230 So , that &apos;s the thought I would leave you with , is that in whatever you &apos;re doing , failure is an option , but fear is not .
ted_00785_1006880_1019730 Thank you . ( Applause )
ted_00790_0012920_0015300 So , I &apos;ve known a lot of fish in my life .
ted_00790_0017290_0018390 I &apos;ve loved only two .
ted_00790_0020300_0024160 That first one , it was more like a passionate affair .
ted_00790_0025130_0031150 It was a beautiful fish : flavorful , textured , meaty , a bestseller on the menu .
ted_00790_0032810_0043720 What a fish . ( Laughter ) Even better , it was farm-raised to the supposed highest standards of sustainability .
ted_00790_0044900_0046140 So you could feel good about selling it .
ted_00790_0048970_0052170 I was in a relationship with this beauty for several months .
ted_00790_0054880_0062470 One day , the head of the company called and asked if I &apos;d speak at an event about the farm &apos;s sustainability . &quot; Absolutely , &quot; I said .
ted_00790_0063660_0071790 Here was a company trying to solve what &apos;s become this unimaginable problem for us chefs : How do we keep fish on our menus ?
ted_00790_0074120_0080380 For the past 50 years , we &apos;ve been fishing the seas like we clear-cut forests .
ted_00790_0082720_0086090 It &apos;s hard to overstate the destruction .
ted_00790_0087850_0093780 Ninety percent of large fish , the ones we love - the tunas , the halibuts , the salmons , swordfish - they &apos;ve collapsed .
ted_00790_0095390_0096350 There &apos;s almost nothing left .
ted_00790_0098670_0103740 So , for better or for worse , aquaculture , fish farming , is going to be a part of our future .
ted_00790_0104330_0110130 A lot of arguments against it : Fish farms pollute - most of them do anyway - and they &apos;re inefficient .
ted_00790_0110220_0117340 Take tuna , a major drawback . It &apos;s got a feed conversion ratio of 15 to one .
ted_00790_0117340_0126440 That means it takes fifteen pounds of wild fish to get you one pound of farm tuna . Not very sustainable . It doesn &apos;t taste very good either .
ted_00790_0127720_0132050 So here , finally , was a company trying to do it right .
ted_00790_0132440_0133300 I wanted to support them .
ted_00790_0135470_0142130 The day before the event , I called the head of P.R. for the company . Let &apos;s call him Don .
ted_00790_0144060_0149820 &quot; Don , &quot; I said , &quot; just to get the facts straight , you guys are famous for farming so far out to sea , you don &apos;t pollute . &quot;
ted_00790_0150170_0162040 &quot; That &apos;s right , &quot; he said . &quot; We &apos;re so far out , the waste from our fish gets distributed , not concentrated . &quot; And then he added , &quot; We &apos;re basically a world unto ourselves .
ted_00790_0163940_0165250 That feed conversion ratio ?
ted_00790_0165260_0168390 2.5 to one , &quot; he said . &quot; Best in the business . &quot;
ted_00790_0169610_0172400 2.5 to one , great . &quot; 2.5 what ?
ted_00790_0172400_0172900 What are you feeding ? &quot;
ted_00790_0172900_0174450 &quot; Sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
ted_00790_0176450_0177240 &quot; Great , &quot; I said .
ted_00790_0177800_0178420 Got off the phone .
ted_00790_0179390_0187720 And that night , I was lying in bed , and I thought : What the hell is a sustainable protein ? ( Laughter )
ted_00790_0189030_0191610 So the next day , just before the event , I called Don .
ted_00790_0191610_0194240 I said , &quot; Don , what are some examples of sustainable proteins ? &quot;
ted_00790_0194240_0196110 He said he didn &apos;t know .
ted_00790_0197750_0198510 He would ask around .
ted_00790_0198720_0207170 Well , I got on the phone with a few people in the company ; no one could give me a straight answer until finally , I got on the phone with the head biologist .
ted_00790_0208520_0214720 Let &apos;s call him Don too . ( Laughter )
ted_00790_0214720_0218230 &quot; Don , &quot; I said , &quot; what are some examples of sustainable proteins ? &quot;
ted_00790_0219280_0224250 Well , he mentioned some algaes and some fish meals , and then he said chicken pellets .
ted_00790_0225420_0226130 I said , &quot; Chicken pellets ? &quot;
ted_00790_0226530_0233460 He said , &quot; Yeah , feathers , skin , bone meal , scraps , dried and processed into feed . &quot;
ted_00790_0234690_0241690 I said , &quot; What percentage of your feed is chicken ? &quot; Thinking , you know , two percent .
ted_00790_0242710_0244300 &quot; Well , it &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
ted_00790_0245440_0250220 I said , &quot; Don , what &apos;s sustainable about feeding chicken to fish ? &quot; ( Laughter )
ted_00790_0255110_0267460 There was a long pause on the line , and he said , &quot; There &apos;s just too much chicken in the world . &quot; ( Laughter )
ted_00790_0267630_0276010 I fell out of love with this fish . ( Laughter ) No , not because I &apos;m some self-righteous , goody-two shoes foodie .
ted_00790_0277410_0292850 I actually am . ( Laughter ) No , I actually fell out of love with this fish because , I swear to God , after that conversation , the fish tasted like chicken . ( Laughter )
ted_00790_0295480_0299890 This second fish , it &apos;s a different kind of love story .
ted_00790_0301170_0308170 It &apos;s the romantic kind , the kind where the more you get to know your fish , you love the fish .
ted_00790_0310530_0313150 I first ate it at a restaurant in southern Spain .
ted_00790_0313870_0316880 A journalist friend had been talking about this fish for a long time .
ted_00790_0317330_0325710 She kind of set us up . ( Laughter ) It came to the table a bright , almost shimmering , white color .
ted_00790_0328090_0336790 The chef had overcooked it . Like twice over . Amazingly , it was still delicious .
ted_00790_0338150_0345840 Who can make a fish taste good after it &apos;s been overcooked ? I can &apos;t , but this guy can .
ted_00790_0347770_0359230 Let &apos;s call him Miguel - actually his name is Miguel . ( Laughter ) And no , he didn &apos;t cook the fish , and he &apos;s not a chef , at least in the way that you and I understand it .
ted_00790_0360240_0363640 He &apos;s a biologist at Veta La Palma .
ted_00790_0364270_0367050 It &apos;s a fish farm in the southwestern corner of Spain .
ted_00790_0367760_0369730 It &apos;s at the tip of the Guadalquivir river .
ted_00790_0370790_0374340 Until the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of the Argentinians .
ted_00790_0375300_0378480 They raised beef cattle on what was essentially wetlands .
ted_00790_0380300_0381640 They did it by draining the land .
ted_00790_0381910_0387570 They built this intricate series of canals , and they pushed water off the land and out into the river .
ted_00790_0389650_0392370 Well , they couldn &apos;t make it work , not economically .
ted_00790_0393030_0395120 And ecologically , it was a disaster .
ted_00790_0395980_0399700 It killed like 90 percent of the birds , which , for this place , is a lot of birds .
ted_00790_0401320_0407020 And so in 1982 , a Spanish company with an environmental conscience purchased the land .
ted_00790_0407020_0410630 What did they do ? They reversed the flow of water .
ted_00790_0410690_0412070 They literally flipped the switch .
ted_00790_0413130_0417370 Instead of pushing water out , they used the channels to pull water back in .
ted_00790_0417410_0418480 They flooded the canals .
ted_00790_0419580_0433240 They created a 27,000-acre fish farm - bass , mullet , shrimp , eel - and in the process , Miguel and this company completely reversed the ecological destruction .
ted_00790_0433240_0436380 The farm &apos;s incredible .
ted_00790_0437280_0439390 I mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
ted_00790_0441400_0449900 You stare out at a horizon that is a million miles away , and all you see are flooded canals and this thick , rich marshland .
ted_00790_0449900_0454150 I was there not long ago with Miguel .
ted_00790_0455470_0462800 He &apos;s an amazing guy , like three parts Charles Darwin and one part Crocodile Dundee . ( Laughter ) Okay ?
ted_00790_0463820_0471990 There we are slogging through the wetlands , and I &apos;m panting and sweating , got mud up to my knees , and Miguel &apos;s calmly conducting a biology lecture .
ted_00790_0472790_0479290 Here , he &apos;s pointing out a rare Black-shouldered Kite . Now , he &apos;s mentioning the mineral needs of phytoplankton .
ted_00790_0480190_0486310 And here , here he sees a grouping pattern that reminds him of the Tanzanian Giraffe .
ted_00790_0488090_0493360 It turns out , Miguel spent the better part of his career in the Mikumi National Park in Africa .
ted_00790_0494520_0497130 I asked him how he became such an expert on fish .
ted_00790_0497950_0498600 He said , &quot; Fish ?
ted_00790_0499340_0500530 I didn &apos;t know anything about fish .
ted_00790_0501110_0510180 I &apos;m an expert in relationships . &quot; And then he &apos;s off , launching into more talk about rare birds and algaes and strange aquatic plants .
ted_00790_0510180_0515190 And don &apos;t get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the biotic community unplugged , kind of thing .
ted_00790_0516100_0518200 It &apos;s great , but I was in love .
ted_00790_0518660_0524690 And my head was swooning over that overcooked piece of delicious fish I had the night before .
ted_00790_0524980_0525730 So I interrupted him .
ted_00790_0525730_0528040 I said , &quot; Miguel , what makes your fish taste so good ? &quot;
ted_00790_0529180_0530170 He pointed at the algae .
ted_00790_0531190_0538340 &quot; I know , dude , the algae , the phytoplankton , the relationships : It &apos;s amazing . But what are your fish eating ?
ted_00790_0538890_0540390 What &apos;s the feed conversion ratio ? &quot;
ted_00790_0542840_0550140 Well , he goes on to tell me it &apos;s such a rich system that the fish are eating what they &apos;d be eating in the wild .
ted_00790_0552190_0556060 The plant biomass , the phytoplankton , the zooplankton , it &apos;s what feeds the fish .
ted_00790_0556440_0559480 The system is so healthy , it &apos;s totally self-renewing .
ted_00790_0560570_0561650 There is no feed .
ted_00790_0563690_0566260 Ever heard of a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals ?
ted_00790_0569940_0582320 Later that day , I was driving around this property with Miguel , and I asked him , I said , &quot; For a place that seems so natural , unlike like any farm I &apos;d ever been at , how do you measure success ? &quot;
ted_00790_0584540_0589270 At that moment , it was as if a film director called for a set change .
ted_00790_0589560_0599740 And we rounded the corner and saw the most amazing sight : thousands and thousands of pink flamingos , a literal pink carpet for as far as you could see .
ted_00790_0600540_0604870 &quot; That &apos;s success , &quot; he said . &quot; Look at their bellies , pink .
ted_00790_0604910_0608260 They &apos;re feasting . &quot; Feasting ?
ted_00790_0608420_0609160 I was totally confused .
ted_00790_0609160_0612890 I said , &quot; Miguel , aren &apos;t they feasting on your fish ? &quot; ( Laughter )
ted_00790_0612930_0625700 &quot; Yes , &quot; he said . ( Laughter ) &quot; We lose 20 percent of our fish and fish eggs to birds .
ted_00790_0627270_0632900 Well , last year , this property had 600,000 birds on it , more than 250 different species .
ted_00790_0632900_0641560 It &apos;s become , today , the largest and one of the most important private bird sanctuaries in all of Europe . &quot;
ted_00790_0643430_0651560 I said , &quot; Miguel , isn &apos;t a thriving bird population like the last thing you want on a fish farm ? &quot; ( Laughter ) He shook his head , no .
ted_00790_0651560_0656650 He said , &quot; We farm extensively , not intensively .
ted_00790_0658440_0660190 This is an ecological network .
ted_00790_0661650_0663660 The flamingos eat the shrimp .
ted_00790_0663820_0665140 The shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
ted_00790_0665260_0667880 So the pinker the belly , the better the system . &quot;
ted_00790_0670700_0679450 Okay , so let &apos;s review : a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals , and a farm that measures its success on the health of its predators .
ted_00790_0680480_0682900 A fish farm , but also a bird sanctuary .
ted_00790_0683820_0687200 Oh , and by the way , those flamingos , they shouldn &apos;t even be there in the first place .
ted_00790_0687710_0693600 They brood in a town 150 miles away , where the soil conditions are better for building nests .
ted_00790_0695030_0699000 Every morning , they fly 150 miles into the farm .
ted_00790_0700780_0720280 And every evening , they fly 150 miles back . ( Laughter ) They do that because they &apos;re able to follow the broken white line of highway A92 . ( Laughter ) No kidding .
ted_00790_0722690_0726530 I was imagining a &quot; March of the Penguins &quot; thing , so I looked at Miguel .
ted_00790_0726530_0734360 I said , &quot; Miguel , do they fly 150 miles to the farm , and then do they fly 150 miles back at night ?
ted_00790_0735170_0737020 Do they do that for the children ? &quot;
ted_00790_0738550_0749290 He looked at me like I had just quoted a Whitney Houston song . ( Laughter ) He said , &quot; No ; they do it because the food &apos;s better . &quot; ( Laughter )
ted_00790_0751000_0763110 I didn &apos;t mention the skin of my beloved fish , which was delicious - and I don &apos;t like fish skin ; I don &apos;t like it seared , I don &apos;t like it crispy .
ted_00790_0763720_0765780 It &apos;s that acrid , tar-like flavor .
ted_00790_0767250_0768370 I almost never cook with it .
ted_00790_0770110_0775460 Yet , when I tasted it at that restaurant in southern Spain , it tasted not at all like fish skin .
ted_00790_0776850_0781670 It tasted sweet and clean , like you were taking a bite of the ocean .
ted_00790_0782490_0784050 I mentioned that to Miguel , and he nodded .
ted_00790_0784050_0786300 He said , &quot; The skin acts like a sponge .
ted_00790_0786780_0788910 It &apos;s the last defense before anything enters the body .
ted_00790_0788990_0796390 It evolved to soak up impurities . &quot; And then he added , &quot; But our water has no impurities . &quot;
ted_00790_0798820_0807670 OK . A farm that doesn &apos;t feed its fish , a farm that measures its success by the success of its predators .
ted_00790_0808550_0819260 And then I realized when he says , &quot; A farm that has no impurities , &quot; he made a big understatement , because the water that flows through that farm comes in from the Guadalquivir River .
ted_00790_0820060_0828140 It &apos;s a river that carries with it all the things that rivers tend to carry these days : chemical contaminants , pesticide runoff .
ted_00790_0828670_0835620 And when it works its way through the system and leaves , the water is cleaner than when it entered .
ted_00790_0836490_0839000 The system is so healthy , it purifies the water .
ted_00790_0840330_0857760 So , not just a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals , not just a farm that measures its success by the health of its predators , but a farm that &apos;s literally a water purification plant - and not just for those fish , but for you and me as well .
ted_00790_0858000_0860710 Because when that water leaves , it dumps out into the Atlantic .
ted_00790_0863710_0875590 A drop in the ocean , I know , but I &apos;ll take it , and so should you , because this love story , however romantic , is also instructive .
ted_00790_0875960_0883250 You might say it &apos;s a recipe for the future of good food , whether we &apos;re talking about bass or beef cattle .
ted_00790_0884720_0902550 What we need now is a radically new conception of agriculture , one in which the food actually tastes good . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) But for a lot people , that &apos;s a bit too radical .
ted_00790_0904020_0907460 We &apos;re not realists , us foodies ; we &apos;re lovers .
ted_00790_0908460_0916050 We love farmers &apos; markets , we love small family farms , we talk about local food , we eat organic .
ted_00790_0918170_0934530 And when you suggest these are the things that will ensure the future of good food , someone , somewhere stands up and says , &quot; Hey guy , I love pink flamingos , but how are you going to feed the world ? &quot; How are you going to feed the world ?
ted_00790_0936120_0938840 Can I be honest ? I don &apos;t love that question .
ted_00790_0940970_0945160 No , not because we already produce enough calories to more than feed the world .
ted_00790_0946170_0949450 One billion people will go hungry today .
ted_00790_0949450_0956790 One billion - that &apos;s more than ever before - because of gross inequalities in distribution , not tonnage .
ted_00790_0958920_0963820 Now , I don &apos;t love this question because it &apos;s determined the logic of our food system for the last 50 years .
ted_00790_0964630_0990120 Feed grain to herbivores , pesticides to monocultures , chemicals to soil , chicken to fish , and all along agribusiness has simply asked , &quot; If we &apos;re feeding more people more cheaply , how terrible could that be ? &quot; That &apos;s been the motivation , it &apos;s been the justification : it &apos;s been the business plan of American agriculture .
ted_00790_0990630_1002150 We should call it what it is : a business in liquidation , a business that &apos;s quickly eroding ecological capital that makes that very production possible .
ted_00790_1002600_1005090 That &apos;s not a business , and it isn &apos;t agriculture .
ted_00790_1006600_1027900 Our breadbasket is threatened today , not because of diminishing supply , but because of diminishing resources . Not by the latest combine and tractor invention , but by fertile land ; not by pumps , but by fresh water ; not by chainsaws , but by forests ; and not by fishing boats and nets , but by fish in the sea .
ted_00790_1028380_1029010 Want to feed the world ?
ted_00790_1029820_1032290 Let &apos;s start by asking : How are we going to feed ourselves ?
ted_00790_1034560_1054300 Or better : How can we create conditions that enable every community to feed itself ? ( Applause ) To do that , don &apos;t look at the agribusiness model for the future .
ted_00790_1054720_1056500 It &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s tired .
ted_00790_1056530_1062570 It &apos;s high on capital , chemistry and machines , and it &apos;s never produced anything really good to eat .
ted_00790_1065430_1068160 Instead , let &apos;s look to the ecological model .
ted_00790_1069060_1074190 That &apos;s the one that relies on two billion years of on-the-job experience .
ted_00790_1075480_1099300 Look to Miguel , farmers like Miguel . Farms that aren &apos;t worlds unto themselves ; farms that restore instead of deplete ; farms that farm extensively instead of just intensively ; farmers that are not just producers , but experts in relationships . Because they &apos;re the ones that are experts in flavor , too .
ted_00790_1100940_1105050 And if I &apos;m going to be really honest , they &apos;re a better chef than I &apos;ll ever be .
ted_00790_1107140_1112280 You know , I &apos;m okay with that , because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it &apos;s going to be delicious .
ted_00790_1112330_1120960 Thank you . ( Applause )
ted_00792_0015170_0053790 For some time I have been interested in the placebo effect , which might seem like an odd thing for a magician to be interested in , unless you think of it in the terms that I do , which is , &quot; Something fake is believed in enough by somebody that it becomes something real . &quot; In other words , sugar pills have a measurable effect in certain kinds of studies , the placebo effect , just because the person thinks that what &apos;s happening to them is a pharmaceutical or some sort of a - for pain management , for example , if they believe it enough there is a measurable effect in the body called the placebo effect .
ted_00792_0053800_0059380 Something fake becomes something real because of someone &apos;s perception of it .
ted_00792_0061180_0066560 In order for us to understand each other , I want to start by showing you a rudimentary , very simple magic trick .
ted_00792_0067080_0068280 And I &apos;m going to show you how it works .
ted_00792_0068280_0072560 This is a trick that &apos;s been in every children &apos;s magic book since at least the 1950s .
ted_00792_0073260_0076580 I learned it myself from Cub Scout Magic in the 1970s .
ted_00792_0077280_0078870 I &apos;ll do it for you , and then I &apos;ll explain it .
ted_00792_0078900_0081050 And then I &apos;ll explain why I explained it .
ted_00792_0082750_0083780 So , here &apos;s what happens .
ted_00792_0083950_0085190 The knife , which you can examine ; my hand , which you could examine .
ted_00792_0086990_0088970 I &apos;m just going to hold the knife in my fist like this .
ted_00792_0089340_0090370 I &apos;ll get my sleeve back .
ted_00792_0091130_0095840 And to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve I &apos;m just going to squeeze my wrist right here .
ted_00792_0096250_0102240 That way you can see that at no time can anything travel , as long as I &apos;m squeezing there nothing can go up or down my sleeve .
ted_00792_0102760_0104340 And the object of this is quite simple .
ted_00792_0105600_0114650 I &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully , if all is well , my pure animal magnetism will hold the knife .
ted_00792_0114650_0119990 In fact it &apos;s held so tightly in place that I can shake it , and the knife does not come off .
ted_00792_0121170_0124050 Nothing goes up or down my sleeve , no trickery .
ted_00792_0124620_0125850 And you can examine everything .
ted_00792_0126570_0128010 Ta-da ! ( Applause )
ted_00792_0130690_0139920 So , this is a trick that I often teach to young children that are interested in magic , because you can learn a great deal about deception by studying this very - even though it &apos;s a very simple trick methodologically .
ted_00792_0139920_0141790 Probably many of you in the room know this trick .
ted_00792_0142620_0143800 What happens is this .
ted_00792_0144290_0145520 I hold the knife in my hand .
ted_00792_0145960_0151310 I say I &apos;m going to grab hold of my wrist to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve , that is a lie .
ted_00792_0152500_0157460 The reason I &apos;m holding onto my wrist is because that &apos;s actually the secret of the illusion .
ted_00792_0157770_0175360 In a moment when my hand moves from facing you to being away from you , this finger right here , my index finger is just going to shift from where it is , to a position pointing out like this . Nice one . Someone who didn &apos;t have a childhood is out there . ( Laughter )
ted_00792_0175530_0177570 So , it goes like this , from here , right .
ted_00792_0177790_0179540 And as I move around my finger shifts .
ted_00792_0179550_0192510 And we could talk about why this is deceptive , why you don &apos;t notice there are only three fingers down here , because the mind , and the way it processes information , it doesn &apos;t count , one , two , three . It groups them . But that &apos;s not really what this is about . Right ? And then I open my hand up .
ted_00792_0192510_0200450 Obviously it &apos;s clinging there , not by animal magnetism , but by chicanery , my index finger being there .
ted_00792_0200800_0206880 And then when I close my finger , same thing , as I move back , this motion kind of covers the moving back of my finger .
ted_00792_0207160_0208160 I take this hand away .
ted_00792_0208400_0209250 You give the knife out .
ted_00792_0209250_0212470 There is a trick you can do for your friends and neighbors . Thanks .
ted_00792_0212880_0216720 Now , ( Laughter ) what does that have to do with the placebo effect ?
ted_00792_0219600_0224150 I read a study a year or so ago that really blew my mind wide open .
ted_00792_0224150_0227900 I &apos;m not a doctor or a researcher , so this , to me , was an astonishing thing .
ted_00792_0228490_0237860 It turns out that if you administer a placebo in the form of a white pill , that &apos;s like aspirin shaped - it &apos;s just a round white pill - it has some certain measurable effect .
ted_00792_0237860_0253820 But if you change the form that you give the placebo in , like you make a smaller pill , and color it blue , and stamp a letter into it , it is actually measurably more effective . Even though neither one of these things has any pharmaceutical - they &apos;re sugar pills .
ted_00792_0254190_0256600 But a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
ted_00792_0257850_0260610 What ? ( Laughter ) That really flipped me out .
ted_00792_0260610_0262890 Turns out though , that that &apos;s not even where it stops .
ted_00792_0263290_0268110 If you have capsules , they &apos;re more effective than tablets in any form .
ted_00792_0268130_0272310 A colored capsule , that &apos;s yellow on one end and red on the other is better than a white capsule .
ted_00792_0273320_0275190 Dosage has something to do with this .
ted_00792_0276100_0287320 One pill twice a day is not as good at three pills - I don &apos;t remember the statistic now . Sorry . But the point is ... ( Laughter ) ... these dosages have something to do with it .
ted_00792_0287340_0288320 And the form has something to do with it .
ted_00792_0288430_0304550 And if you want the ultimate in placebo , you &apos;ve go to the needle . Right ? A syringe with some inert - a couple CCs of some inert something , and you inject this into a patient ... Well this is such a powerful image in their mind , it &apos;s so much stronger than the white pill .
ted_00792_0304550_0308930 It &apos;s a really , this graph , well I &apos;ll show it to you some other time when we have slides .
ted_00792_0308960_0316680 The point is the white pill is not as good as the blue pill is not as good as the capsule is not as good as the needle .
ted_00792_0316940_0326160 And none of it has any real pharmaceutical quality , it &apos;s only your belief that makes it real in your body and makes a stronger effect .
ted_00792_0327290_0331310 I wanted to see if I could take that idea and apply it to a magic trick .
ted_00792_0331590_0337270 And take something that is obviously a fake trick and make it seem real .
ted_00792_0340490_0345360 And we know from that study that when you want reality , you go to the needle .
ted_00792_0347620_0349300 This is a seven-inch hatpin .
ted_00792_0349300_0355840 It &apos;s very , very sharp , and I &apos;m going to just sterilize it a tiny bit .
ted_00792_0357730_0359340 This is really my flesh .
ted_00792_0359360_0362180 This is not Damian &apos;s special-grown flesh .
ted_00792_0362210_0363550 That &apos;s my skin right there .
ted_00792_0363550_0365090 This is not a Hollywood special effect .
ted_00792_0366880_0371010 I &apos;m going to pierce my skin and run this needle through to the other side .
ted_00792_0371790_0381390 If you &apos;re queasy - ( Laughs ) if you faint easily - I was doing this for some friends in the hotel room last night , and some people that I didn &apos;t know , and one woman almost passed out .
ted_00792_0381390_0388660 So , I suggest if you get queasy easy that you look away for about the next 30 - in fact , you know what , I &apos;ll do the first bad part behind it .
ted_00792_0388970_0391070 You &apos;ll get to see , you can look away too if you &apos;d like to .
ted_00792_0392330_0399410 So , here is what happens , right here , the beginning of my flesh at the lower part of my arm I just make a little pierce .
ted_00792_0399790_0400550 I &apos;m sorry , man .
ted_00792_0400660_0401840 Am I freaking you out ?
ted_00792_0402270_0408540 OK , and then just through my skin a tiny bit , and then out the other side like this .
ted_00792_0410750_0419820 Now , essentially we &apos;re in the same position we were in with the knife trick . ( Laughter ) Sort of .
ted_00792_0420980_0423150 But you can &apos;t count my fingers right now can you ?
ted_00792_0423560_0424440 So , let me show them to you .
ted_00792_0424440_0429240 That &apos;s one , two three , four , five . Yes , well ...
ted_00792_0431890_0433490 I know what people think when they see this .
ted_00792_0433490_0439140 They go , &quot; Well , he &apos;s certainly not dumb enough to stab himself through the skin to entertain us for a few minutes .
ted_00792_0439940_0441240 So , let me give you a little peek .
ted_00792_0443000_0444180 How &apos;s that look out there ?
ted_00792_0444220_0454630 Pretty good . ( Laughs ) Yeah , I know . ( Laughs ) And the people in the back go , &quot; OK , I didn &apos;t really see that . &quot; People in the satellite room are starting to move in now .
ted_00792_0455140_0456620 Let me give you good close look at this .
ted_00792_0456700_0458120 That really is my skin .
ted_00792_0458130_0459760 That is not a Hollywood special effect .
ted_00792_0459770_0466730 That &apos;s my flesh , and I can twist that around . I &apos;m sorry . If you &apos;re getting queasy , look away , don &apos;t look at the thing .
ted_00792_0467310_0509380 People in the back or people on video years from now watching this will go , &quot; Well yeah , that looks kind of neat in some sort of effect there , but if it were real he would be - see there &apos;s a hole there and a hole there , if it were real he would be bleeding . Well let me work up some blood for you . ( Laughter ) Yes , there it is . ( Applause ) ( Laughter )
ted_00792_0509550_0510670 Normally now , I would take the needle out .
ted_00792_0510670_0529790 I would clean off my arm , and I would show you that there are no wounds . But I think in this context and with the idea of taking something fake and making it into something real , I &apos;m just going to leave it there , and walk off the stage . ( Laughter ) I will be seeing you several times over the next few days .
ted_00792_0530260_0532000 I hope you &apos;re looking forward to that .
ted_00792_0532090_0537520 Thank you very much . ( Laughter ) ( Applause )
ted_00799_0012220_0014110 I &apos;m Jane McGonigal . I &apos;m a game designer .
ted_00799_0014330_0028320 I &apos;ve been making games online now for 10 years , and my goal for the next decade is to try to make it as easy to save the world in real life as it is to save the world in online games .
ted_00799_0028730_0038190 Now , I have a plan for this , and it entails convincing more people , including all of you , to spend more time playing bigger and better games .
ted_00799_0038490_0043170 Right now we spend three billion hours a week playing online games .
ted_00799_0043230_0047150 Some of you might be thinking , &quot; That &apos;s a lot of time to spend playing games .
ted_00799_0047170_0058580 Maybe too much time , considering how many urgent problems we have to solve in the real world . &quot; But actually , according to my research at the Institute for the Future , actually the opposite is true .
ted_00799_0058820_0064580 Three billion hours a week is not nearly enough game play to solve the world &apos;s most urgent problems .
ted_00799_0064960_0071390 In fact , I believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to increase that total dramatically .
ted_00799_0071560_0076710 I &apos;ve calculated the total we need at 21 billion hours of game play every week .
ted_00799_0077550_0095970 So , that &apos;s probably a bit of a counter-intuitive idea , so I &apos;ll say it again , let it sink in : If we want to solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflict , obesity , I believe that we need to aspire to play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week , by the end of the next decade .
ted_00799_0096160_0106290 ( Laughter ) No . I &apos;m serious . I am . Here &apos;s why . This picture pretty much sums up why I think games are so essential to the future survival of the human species . ( Laughter )
ted_00799_0106630_0110450 Truly . This is a portrait by photographer Phil Toledano .
ted_00799_0110460_0115520 He wanted to capture the emotion of gaming , so he set up a camera in front of gamers while they were playing .
ted_00799_0115740_0118680 And this is a classic gaming emotion .
ted_00799_0118870_0122640 Now , if you &apos;re not a gamer , you might miss some of the nuance in this photo .
ted_00799_0122640_0132880 You probably see the sense of urgency , a little bit of fear , but intense concentration , deep , deep focus on tackling a really difficult problem .
ted_00799_0133290_0143600 If you are a gamer , you will notice a few nuances here : the crinkle of the eyes up , and around the mouth is a sign of optimism , and the eyebrows up is surprise .
ted_00799_0143650_0152620 This is a gamer who &apos;s on the verge of something called an &quot; epic win . &quot; ( Laughter ) Oh , you &apos;ve heard of that . OK , good , so we have some gamers among us .
ted_00799_0153040_0160040 An epic win is an outcome that is so extraordinarily positive , you had no idea it was even possible until you achieved it .
ted_00799_0160770_0167040 It was almost beyond the threshold of imagination , and when you get there , you &apos;re shocked to discover what you &apos;re truly capable of .
ted_00799_0167120_0168050 That &apos;s an epic win .
ted_00799_0168350_0170650 This is a gamer on the verge of an epic win .
ted_00799_0170850_0183680 And this is the face that we need to see on millions of problem-solvers all over the world as we try to tackle the obstacles of the next century - the face of someone who , against all odds , is on the verge of an epic win .
ted_00799_0183920_0190030 Now , unfortunately this is more of the face that we see in everyday life now as we try to tackle urgent problems .
ted_00799_0190200_0192620 This is what I call the &quot; I &apos;m Not Good At Life &quot; face .
ted_00799_0192840_0197960 This is actually me making it . Can you see ? Yes . Good . This is me making the &quot; I &apos;m Not Good At Life &quot; face .
ted_00799_0198220_0205660 This is a piece of graffiti in my old neighborhood in Berkeley , California , where I did my PhD on why we &apos;re better in games than we are in real life .
ted_00799_0205890_0207910 And this is a problem that a lot of gamers have .
ted_00799_0208220_0212320 We feel that we are not as good in reality as we are in games .
ted_00799_0212690_0215750 I don &apos;t mean just good as in successful , although that &apos;s part of it .
ted_00799_0215940_0217590 We do achieve more in game worlds .
ted_00799_0217840_0224470 But I also mean good as in motivated to do something that matters - inspired to collaborate and to cooperate .
ted_00799_0224690_0236060 And when we &apos;re in game worlds , I believe that many of us become the best version of ourselves - the most likely to help at a moment &apos;s notice , the most likely to stick with a problem as long at it takes , to get up after failure and try again .
ted_00799_0236880_0242770 And in real life , when we face failure , when we confront obstacles , we often don &apos;t feel that way .
ted_00799_0242920_0249240 We feel overcome , we feel overwhelmed , we feel anxious , maybe depressed , frustrated or cynical .
ted_00799_0249670_0253290 We never have those feelings when we &apos;re playing games , they just don &apos;t exist in games .
ted_00799_0253530_0256200 So that &apos;s what I wanted to study when I was a graduate student .
ted_00799_0256730_0261620 What about games makes it impossible to feel that we can &apos;t achieve everything ?
ted_00799_0261630_0265540 How can we take those feelings from games and apply them to real-world work ?
ted_00799_0265670_0271380 So I looked at games like World of Warcraft , which is really the ideal collaborative problem-solving environment .
ted_00799_0271540_0276360 And I started to notice a few things that make epic wins so possible in online worlds .
ted_00799_0276880_0288060 The first thing is whenever you show up in one of these online games , especially in World of Warcraft , there are lots and lots of different characters who are willing to trust you with a world-saving mission , right away .
ted_00799_0288130_0295300 But not just any mission , it &apos;s a mission that is perfectly matched with your current level in the game . Right ? So you can do it .
ted_00799_0295310_0297420 They never give you a challenge you can &apos;t achieve .
ted_00799_0297440_0301050 But it is on the verge of what you &apos;re capable of , so you have to try hard .
ted_00799_0301250_0307890 But there &apos;s no unemployment in World of Warcraft ; no sitting around , wringing your hands - there &apos;s always something specific and important to be done .
ted_00799_0308300_0309560 There are also tons of collaborators .
ted_00799_0310220_0315920 Everywhere you go , hundreds of thousands of people ready to work with you to achieve your epic mission .
ted_00799_0316090_0321270 That &apos;s not something we have in real life that easily , this sense that at our fingertips are tons of collaborators .
ted_00799_0321870_0328270 And there &apos;s this epic story , this inspiring story of why we &apos;re there , and what we &apos;re doing , and we get all this positive feedback .
ted_00799_0328270_0332150 You guys have heard of leveling up , + 1 strength , + 1 intelligence .
ted_00799_0332570_0334670 We don &apos;t get that kind of constant feedback in real life .
ted_00799_0334680_0342560 When I get off this stage , I &apos;m not going to have + 1 speaking , and + 1 crazy idea , + 20 crazy idea .
ted_00799_0343110_0344590 I don &apos;t get that feedback in real life .
ted_00799_0345300_0356000 Now , the problem with collaborative online environments like World of Warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying to be on the verge of an epic win all the time , we decide to spend all our time in these game worlds .
ted_00799_0356000_0357440 It &apos;s just better than reality .
ted_00799_0357730_0367930 So , so far , collectively all the World of Warcraft gamers have spent 5.93 million years solving the virtual problems of Azeroth .
ted_00799_0367960_0370160 Now , that &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
ted_00799_0370540_0371750 It might sound like it &apos;s a bad thing .
ted_00799_0372040_0380340 But to put that in context : 5.93 million years ago was when our earliest primate human ancestors stood up .
ted_00799_0380380_0383080 That was the first upright primate .
ted_00799_0383850_0397010 So when we talk about how much time we &apos;re currently investing in playing games , the only way it makes sense to even think about it is to talk about time at the magnitude of human evolution , which is an extraordinary thing .
ted_00799_0397180_0404890 But it &apos;s also apt , because it turns out that by spending all this time playing games , we &apos;re actually changing what we are capable of as human beings .
ted_00799_0404900_0409750 We &apos;re evolving to be a more collaborative and hearty species . This is true . I believe this .
ted_00799_0410430_0425280 So , consider this really interesting statistic ; it was recently published by a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University : The average young person today in a country with a strong gamer culture will have spent 10,000 hours playing online games by the age of 21 .
ted_00799_0425440_0429010 Now 10,000 hours is a really interesting number for two reasons .
ted_00799_0429010_0441350 First of all , for children in the United States , 10,080 hours is the exact amount of time you will spend in school , from fifth grade to high school graduation , if you have perfect attendance .
ted_00799_0441350_0452350 ( Laughter ) So , we have an entire parallel track of education going on , where young people are learning as much about what it takes to be a good gamer as they &apos;re learning about everything else in school .
ted_00799_0452350_0459940 Some of you have probably read Malcolm Gladwell &apos;s new book &quot; Outliers , &quot; so you would have heard of his theory of success , the &quot; 10,000 hours &quot; theory of success .
ted_00799_0459970_0471050 It &apos;s based on this great cognitive-science research that says if we can master 10,000 hours of effortful study at anything by the age of 21 , we will be virtuosos at it .
ted_00799_0471050_0474450 We will be as good at whatever we do as the greatest people in the world .
ted_00799_0474450_0480000 And so , now what we &apos;re looking at is an entire generation of young people who are virtuoso gamers .
ted_00799_0480000_0493480 So , the big question is , &quot; What exactly are gamers getting so good at ? &quot; Because if we could figure that out , we would have a virtually unprecedented human resource on our hands .
ted_00799_0493490_0499010 This is how many people we now have in the world who spend at least an hour a day playing online games .
ted_00799_0499010_0504140 These are our virtuoso gamers , 500 million people who are extraordinarily good at something .
ted_00799_0504140_0512070 And in the next decade , we &apos;re going to have another billion gamers who are extraordinarily good at whatever that is .
ted_00799_0512070_0514540 If you don &apos;t know it already , this is coming .
ted_00799_0514540_0526460 The game industry is developing consoles that are low-energy and that work with the wireless phone networks instead of broadband Internet , so that gamers all over the world , particularly in India , China , Brazil , can get online .
ted_00799_0526660_0530070 They expect one billion more gamers in the next decade .
ted_00799_0530070_0531640 It will bring us up to 1.5 billion gamers .
ted_00799_0531990_0536120 So I &apos;ve started to think about what these games are making us virtuosos at .
ted_00799_0536130_0538300 Here are the four things I came up with .
ted_00799_0538300_0542100 The first is urgent optimism . OK , think of this as extreme self-motivation .
ted_00799_0542100_0551470 Urgent optimism is the desire to act immediately to tackle an obstacle , combined with the belief that we have a reasonable hope of success .
ted_00799_0551470_0557170 Gamers always believe that an epic win is possible , and that it &apos;s always worth trying , and trying now .
ted_00799_0557170_0558270 Gamers don &apos;t sit around .
ted_00799_0558270_0562850 Gamers are virtuosos at weaving a tight social fabric .
ted_00799_0562850_0573640 There &apos;s a lot of interesting research that shows we like people better after we play a game with them , even if they &apos;ve beaten us badly . And the reason is , it takes a lot of trust to play a game with someone .
ted_00799_0573640_0580970 We trust that they will spend their time with us , that they will play by the same rules , value the same goal , stay with the game until it &apos;s over .
ted_00799_0580970_0584780 And so , playing a game together actually builds up bonds and trust and cooperation .
ted_00799_0584860_0597640 And we actually build stronger social relationships as a result . Blissful productivity . I love it . You know , there &apos;s a reason why the average World of Warcraft gamer plays for 22 hours a week - kind of a half-time job .
ted_00799_0597640_0604310 It &apos;s because we know , when we &apos;re playing a game , that we &apos;re actually happier working hard than we are relaxing , or hanging out .
ted_00799_0604310_0608730 We know that we are optimized as human beings , to do hard and meaningful work .
ted_00799_0608740_0613580 And gamers are willing to work hard all the time , if they &apos;re given the right work .
ted_00799_0613580_0621330 Finally : epic meaning . Gamers love to be attached to awe-inspiring missions to human planetary-scale stories .
ted_00799_0621630_0631410 So , just one bit of trivia that helps put that into perspective : So , you all know Wikipedia , biggest wiki in the world .
ted_00799_0631790_0636890 Second biggest wiki in the world , with nearly 80,000 articles , is the World of Warcraft wiki .
ted_00799_0636950_0639180 Five million people use it every month .
ted_00799_0639180_0646270 They have compiled more information about World of Warcraft on the Internet than any other topic covered on any other wiki in the world .
ted_00799_0646280_0647420 They are building an epic story .
ted_00799_0647780_0651330 They are building an epic knowledge resource about the World of Warcraft .
ted_00799_0651340_0657920 Okay , so these are four superpowers that add up to one thing : Gamers are super-empowered hopeful individuals .
ted_00799_0658360_0664410 These are people who believe that they are individually capable of changing the world .
ted_00799_0664460_0671820 And the only problem is , they believe that they are capable of changing virtual worlds and not the real world .
ted_00799_0671820_0674320 That &apos;s the problem that I &apos;m trying to solve .
ted_00799_0674380_0677930 There &apos;s an economist named Edward Castronova . His work is brilliant .
ted_00799_0677930_0682710 He looks at why people are investing so much time and energy and money in online worlds .
ted_00799_0682720_0693300 And he says , &quot; We &apos;re witnessing what amounts to no less than a mass exodus to virtual worlds and online game environments . &quot; And he &apos;s an economist , so he &apos;s rational . And he says -
ted_00799_0693300_0693500 ( Laughter )
ted_00799_0693470_0698170 Not like me , I &apos;m a game designer ; I &apos;m exuberant .
ted_00799_0698170_0706400 But he says that this makes perfect sense , because gamers can achieve more in online worlds than they can in real life .
ted_00799_0706400_0714380 They can have stronger social relationships in games than they can have in real life ; they get better feedback and feel more rewarded in games than they do in real life .
ted_00799_0714380_0720020 So he says , for now it makes perfect sense for gamers to spend more time in virtual worlds than the real world .
ted_00799_0720020_0723220 Now , I also agree that that is rational , for now .
ted_00799_0723240_0725570 But it is not , by any means , an optimal situation .
ted_00799_0725660_0729190 We have to start making the real world work more like a game .
ted_00799_0729190_0732880 I take my inspiration from something that happened 2,500 years ago .
ted_00799_0732880_0736840 These are ancient dice , made out of sheep &apos;s knuckles .
ted_00799_0736860_0740560 Before we had awesome game controllers , we had sheep &apos;s knuckles .
ted_00799_0740640_0754710 And these represent the first game equipment designed by human beings , and if you &apos;re familiar with the work of the ancient Greek historian Herodotus , you might know this history , which is the history of who invented games and why .
ted_00799_0754710_0761830 Herodotus says that games , particularly dice games , were invented in the kingdom of Lydia , during a time of famine .
ted_00799_0761840_0773710 Apparently , there was such a severe famine that the king of Lydia decided they had to do something crazy . People were suffering . People were fighting . It was an extreme situation , they needed an extreme solution .
ted_00799_0773710_0785880 So , according to Herodotus , they invented dice games , and they set up a kingdom-wide policy : On one day , everybody would eat , and on the next day , everybody would play games .
ted_00799_0785880_0796400 And they would be so immersed in playing the dice games , because games are so engaging , and immerse us in such satisfying , blissful productivity , they would ignore the fact that they had no food to eat .
ted_00799_0796400_0800500 And then on the next day , they would play games ; and on the next day , they would eat .
ted_00799_0800500_0808420 And according to Herodotus , they passed 18 years this way , surviving through a famine , by eating on one day , and playing games on the next .
ted_00799_0808420_0812090 Now , this is exactly , I think , how we &apos;re using games today .
ted_00799_0812130_0824480 We &apos;re using games to escape real-world suffering - we &apos;re using games to get away from everything that &apos;s broken in the real environment , everything that &apos;s not satisfying about real life , and we &apos;re getting what we need from games .
ted_00799_0824480_0826110 But it doesn &apos;t have to end there .
ted_00799_0826420_0827150 This is really exciting .
ted_00799_0827150_0836450 According to Herodotus , after 18 years the famine wasn &apos;t getting better , so the king decided they would play one final dice game .
ted_00799_0836450_0838370 They divided the entire kingdom in half .
ted_00799_0839370_0845150 They played one dice game , and the winners of that game got to go on an epic adventure .
ted_00799_0845280_0857530 They would leave Lydia , and they would go out in search of a new place to live , leaving behind just enough people to survive on the resources that were available , and hopefully to take their civilization somewhere else where they could thrive .
ted_00799_0857530_0859080 Now , this sounds crazy , right ?
ted_00799_0859080_0869200 But recently , DNA evidence has shown that the Etruscans , who then led to the Roman Empire , actually share the same DNA as the ancient Lydians .
ted_00799_0869200_0873960 And so , recently , scientists have suggested that Herodotus &apos; crazy story is actually true .
ted_00799_0873960_0881300 And geologists have found evidence of a global cooling that lasted for nearly 20 years , that could have explained the famine .
ted_00799_0881310_0882940 So this crazy story might be true .
ted_00799_0883080_0895830 They might have actually saved their culture by playing games , escaping to games for 18 years , and then been so inspired , and knew so much about how to come together with games , that they actually saved the entire civilization that way .
ted_00799_0895830_0897480 Okay , we can do that . ( Laughter )
ted_00799_0897480_0899110 We &apos;ve been playing Warcraft since 1994 .
ted_00799_0900290_0904580 That was the first real-time strategy game from the World of Warcraft series .
ted_00799_0904580_0905230 That was 16 years ago .
ted_00799_0905410_0910110 They played dice games for 18 years , we &apos;ve been playing Warcraft for 16 years .
ted_00799_0910180_0913410 I say we are ready for our own epic game .
ted_00799_0913410_0922090 Now , they had half the civilization go off in search of a new world , so that &apos;s where I get my 21 billion hours a week of game-play from .
ted_00799_0922110_0927610 Let &apos;s get half of us to agree to spend an hour a day playing games , until we solve real-world problems .
ted_00799_0927610_0936610 Now , I know you &apos;re asking , &quot; How are we going to solve real-world problems in games ? &quot; Well , that &apos;s what I &apos;ve devoted my work to over the past few years , at the Institute for the Future .
ted_00799_0936620_0943850 We have this banner in our offices in Palo Alto , and it expresses our view of how we should try to relate to the future .
ted_00799_0943850_0945910 We do not want to try to predict the future .
ted_00799_0945910_0948030 What we want to do is make the future .
ted_00799_0948030_0953530 We want to imagine the best-case scenario outcome , and then we want to empower people to make that outcome a reality .
ted_00799_0953560_0958750 We want to imagine epic wins , and then give people the means to achieve the epic win .
ted_00799_0958810_0966190 I &apos;m just going to very briefly show you three games that I &apos;ve made that are an attempt to give people the means to create epic wins in their own futures .
ted_00799_0966190_0967380 This is World Without Oil .
ted_00799_0967380_0969420 We made this game in 2007 .
ted_00799_0969430_0973460 This is an online game in which you try to survive an oil shortage .
ted_00799_0973480_0983900 The oil shortage is fictional , but we put enough online content out there for you to believe that it &apos;s real , and to live your real life as if we &apos;ve run out of oil .
ted_00799_0984060_1003310 So when you come to the game , you sign up , tell us where you live , and then we give you real-time news videos , data feeds that show you exactly how much oil costs , what &apos;s not available , how food supply is being affected , how transportation is being affected , if schools are closed , if there &apos;s rioting , and you have to figure out how you would live your real life as if this were true .
ted_00799_1003310_1006620 And then we ask you to blog about it , to post videos , to post photos .
ted_00799_1006620_1012780 We piloted this game with 1,700 players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve tracked them for the three years since .
ted_00799_1012780_1015150 And I can tell you that this is a transformative experience .
ted_00799_1015150_1021050 Nobody wants to change how they live , just because it &apos;s good for the world , or because we &apos;re supposed to .
ted_00799_1021050_1025960 But if you immerse them in an epic adventure and tell them , &quot; We &apos;ve run out of oil .
ted_00799_1026160_1029280 This is an amazing story and adventure for you to go on .
ted_00799_1029290_1035310 Challenge yourself to see how you would survive , &quot; most of our players have kept up the habits that they learned in this game .
ted_00799_1035310_1040420 So for the next world-saving game , we decided to aim higher - bigger problem than just peak oil .
ted_00799_1040430_1044290 We did a game called Superstruct at the Institute for the Future .
ted_00799_1044290_1050620 And the premise was , a supercomputer has calculated that humans have only 23 years left on the planet .
ted_00799_1050620_1054180 This supercomputer was called the Global Extinction Awareness System , of course .
ted_00799_1054180_1058040 We asked people to come online - almost like a Jerry Bruckheimer movie .
ted_00799_1058050_1067240 You know Jerry Bruckheimer movies , you form a dream team - you &apos;ve got the astronaut , the scientist , the ex-convict , and they all have something to do to save the world .
ted_00799_1067340_1083520 But in our game , instead of just having five people on the dream team , we said , &quot; Everybody &apos;s on the dream team , and it &apos;s your job to invent the future of energy , the future of food , the future of health , the future of security and the future of the social safety net . &quot; We had 8,000 people play that game for eight weeks .
ted_00799_1083550_1088760 They came up with 500 insanely creative solutions that you can go online , Google &quot; Superstruct , &quot; and see .
ted_00799_1088930_1091710 So , finally , the last game , we &apos;re launching it March 3rd .
ted_00799_1091710_1094710 This is a game done with the World Bank Institute .
ted_00799_1094710_1099960 If you complete the game , you will be certified by the World Bank Institute as a Social Innovator , class of 2010 .
ted_00799_1099970_1107310 Working with universities all over sub-Saharan Africa , and we are inviting them to learn social innovation skills .
ted_00799_1107330_1113560 We &apos;ve got a graphic novel , we &apos;ve got leveling up in skills like local insight , knowledge networking , sustainability , vision and resourcefulness .
ted_00799_1113560_1128200 I would like to invite all of you to please share this game with young people , anywhere in the world , particularly in developing areas , who might benefit from coming together to try to start to imagine their own social enterprises to save the world .
ted_00799_1128200_1132160 So , I &apos;m going to wrap up now . I want to ask a question .
ted_00799_1132160_1134060 What do you think happens next ?
ted_00799_1134070_1142220 We &apos;ve got all these amazing gamers , we &apos;ve got these games that are kind of pilots of what we might do , but none of them have saved the real world yet .
ted_00799_1142220_1150740 Well I hope you will agree with me that gamers are a human resource that we can use to do real-world work , that games are a powerful platform for change .
ted_00799_1150740_1159710 We have all these amazing superpowers : blissful productivity , the ability to weave a tight social fabric , this feeling of urgent optimism and the desire for epic meaning .
ted_00799_1159710_1165880 I really hope that we can come together to play games that matter , to survive on this planet for another century .
ted_00799_1165880_1169740 That &apos;s my hope , that you will join me in making and playing games like this .
ted_00799_1169740_1181030 When I look forward to the next decade , I know two things for sure : that we can make any future we can imagine , and we can play any games we want , so I say : Let the world-changing games begin .
ted_00799_1181420_1181720 Thank you .

ted_00805_0013510_0021430 One day , Los Angeles Times columnist Steve Lopez was walking along the streets of downtown Los Angeles when he heard beautiful music .
ted_00805_0022230_0032570 And the source was a man , an African-American man , charming , rugged , homeless , playing a violin that only had two strings .
ted_00805_0033480_0053120 And I &apos;m telling a story that many of you know , because Steve &apos;s columns became the basis for a book , which was turned into a movie , with Robert Downey Jr. acting as Steve Lopez , and Jamie Foxx as Nathaniel Anthony Ayers , the Juilliard-trained double bassist whose promising career was cut short by a tragic affliction with paranoid schizophrenia .
ted_00805_0054900_0062620 Nathaniel dropped out of Juilliard , he suffered a complete breakdown , and 30 years later he was living homeless on the streets of Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles .
ted_00805_0063480_0079330 I encourage all of you to read Steve &apos;s book or to watch the movie to understand not only the beautiful bond that formed between these two men , but how music helped shape that bond , and ultimately was instrumental - if you &apos;ll pardon the pun - in helping Nathaniel get off the streets .
ted_00805_0080970_0084720 I met Mr. Ayers in 2008 , two years ago , at Walt Disney Concert Hall .
ted_00805_0084910_0090440 He had just heard a performance of Beethoven &apos;s First and Fourth symphonies , and came backstage and introduced himself .
ted_00805_0090520_0103450 He was speaking in a very jovial and gregarious way about Yo-Yo Ma and Hillary Clinton and how the Dodgers were never going to make the World Series , all because of the treacherous first violin passage work in the last movement of Beethoven &apos;s Fourth Symphony .
ted_00805_0105010_0111540 And we got talking about music , and I got an email from Steve a few days later saying that Nathaniel was interested in a violin lesson with me .
ted_00805_0113050_0124550 Now , I should mention that Nathaniel refuses treatment because when he was treated it was with shock therapy and Thorazine and handcuffs , and that scar has stayed with him for his entire life .
ted_00805_0125230_0142360 But as a result now , he is prone to these schizophrenic episodes , the worst of which can manifest themselves as him exploding and then disappearing for days , wandering the streets of Skid Row , exposed to its horrors , with the torment of his own mind unleashed upon him .
ted_00805_0143760_0153780 And Nathaniel was in such a state of agitation when we started our first lesson at Walt Disney Concert Hall - he had a kind of manic glint in his eyes , he was lost .
ted_00805_0154410_0161480 And he was talking about invisible demons and smoke , and how someone was poisoning him in his sleep .
ted_00805_0162520_0183020 And I was afraid , not for myself , but I was afraid that I was going to lose him , that he was going to sink into one of his states , and that I would ruin his relationship with the violin if I started talking about scales and arpeggios and other exciting forms of didactic violin pedagogy . ( Laughter ) So , I just started playing .
ted_00805_0184310_0186980 And I played the first movement of the Beethoven Violin Concerto .
ted_00805_0188120_0194700 And as I played , I understood that there was a profound change occurring in Nathaniel &apos;s eyes .
ted_00805_0195510_0203460 It was as if he was in the grip of some invisible pharmaceutical , a chemical reaction , for which my playing the music was its catalyst .
ted_00805_0205180_0215690 And Nathaniel &apos;s manic rage was transformed into understanding , a quiet curiosity and grace .
ted_00805_0218020_0229470 And in a miracle , he lifted his own violin and he started playing , by ear , certain snippets of violin concertos which he then asked me to complete - Mendelssohn , Tchaikovsky , Sibelius .
ted_00805_0229970_0237820 And we started talking about music , from Bach to Beethoven and Brahms , Bruckner , all the B &apos;s , from Bartók , all the way up to Esa-Pekka Salonen .
ted_00805_0238420_0245680 And I understood that he not only had an encyclopedic knowledge of music , but he related to this music at a personal level .
ted_00805_0246060_0251750 He spoke about it with the kind of passion and understanding that I share with my colleagues in the Los Angeles Philharmonic .
ted_00805_0253550_0269510 And through playing music and talking about music , this man had transformed from the paranoid , disturbed man that had just come from walking the streets of downtown Los Angeles to the charming , erudite , brilliant , Juilliard-trained musician .
ted_00805_0271810_0279510 Music is medicine . Music changes us . And for Nathaniel , music is sanity .
ted_00805_0280290_0288020 Because music allows him to take his thoughts and delusions and shape them through his imagination and his creativity , into reality .
ted_00805_0288910_0292040 And that is an escape from his tormented state .
ted_00805_0293180_0309570 And I understood that this was the very essence of art . This was the very reason why we made music , that we take something that exists within all of us at our very fundamental core , our emotions , and through our artistic lens , through our creativity , we &apos;re able to shape those emotions into reality .
ted_00805_0311460_0318880 And the reality of that expression reaches all of us and moves us , inspires and unites us .
ted_00805_0320340_0324440 And for Nathaniel , music brought him back into a fold of friends .
ted_00805_0325000_0334640 The redemptive power of music brought him back into a family of musicians that understood him , that recognized his talents and respected him .
ted_00805_0336250_0346100 And I will always make music with Nathaniel , whether we &apos;re at Walt Disney Concert Hall or on Skid Row , because he reminds me why I became a musician .
ted_00805_0347210_0347550 Thank you . ( Applause )
ted_00805_0355050_0356730 Bruno Giussani : Thank you . Thanks . Robert Gupta . ( Applause )
ted_00805_0379670_0382290 Robert Gupta : I &apos;m going to play something that I shamelessly stole from cellists .
ted_00805_0382590_0383470 So , please forgive me .
ted_00824_0012830_0018030 Let &apos;s pretend right here we have a machine . A big machine , a cool , TED-ish machine , and it &apos;s a time machine .
ted_00824_0018650_0020530 And everyone in this room has to get into it .
ted_00824_0020790_0024470 And you can go backwards , you can go forwards ; you cannot stay where you are .
ted_00824_0024740_0030260 And I wonder what you &apos;d choose , because I &apos;ve been asking my friends this question a lot lately and they all want to go back . I don &apos;t know .
ted_00824_0030260_0035690 They want to go back before there were automobiles or Twitter or &quot; American Idol . &quot; I don &apos;t know .
ted_00824_0036370_0042040 I &apos;m convinced that there &apos;s some sort of pull to nostalgia , to wishful thinking . And I understand that .
ted_00824_0042250_0044200 I &apos;m not part of that crowd , I have to say .
ted_00824_0044660_0046940 I don &apos;t want to go back , and it &apos;s not because I &apos;m adventurous .
ted_00824_0046940_0050970 It &apos;s because possibilities on this planet , they don &apos;t go back , they go forward .
ted_00824_0051180_0053470 So I want to get in the machine , and I want to go forward .
ted_00824_0054090_0066310 This is the greatest time there &apos;s ever been on this planet by any measure that you wish to choose : health , wealth , mobility , opportunity , declining rates of disease ... There &apos;s never been a time like this .
ted_00824_0066750_0070500 My great-grandparents died , all of them , by the time they were 60 .
ted_00824_0070890_0073230 My grandparents pushed that number to 70 .
ted_00824_0073490_0075170 My parents are closing in on 80 .
ted_00824_0075440_0080110 So there better be a nine at the beginning of my death number .
ted_00824_0081090_0085620 But it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a bigger deal than that .
ted_00824_0086040_0094170 A kid born in New Delhi today can expect to live as long as the richest man in the world did 100 years ago . Think about that , it &apos;s an incredible fact .
ted_00824_0094170_0099580 And why is it true ? Smallpox . Smallpox killed billions of people on this planet .
ted_00824_0099760_0114630 It reshaped the demography of the globe in a way that no war ever has . It &apos;s gone . It &apos;s vanished . We vanquished it . Puff . In the rich world , diseases that threatened millions of us just a generation ago no longer exist , hardly .
ted_00824_0114780_0118730 Diphtheria , rubella , polio ... does anyone even know what those things are ?
ted_00824_0120330_0127350 Vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , those are triumphs of the scientific method .
ted_00824_0127350_0136370 And to my mind , the scientific method - trying stuff out , seeing if it works , changing it when it doesn &apos;t - is one of the great accomplishments of humanity .
ted_00824_0136570_0150340 So that &apos;s the good news . Unfortunately , that &apos;s all the good news because there are some other problems , and they &apos;ve been mentioned many times . And one of them is that despite all our accomplishments , a billion people go to bed hungry in this world every day .
ted_00824_0150970_0154090 That number &apos;s rising , and it &apos;s rising really rapidly , and it &apos;s disgraceful .
ted_00824_0154090_0159050 And not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to thoroughly trash this globe .
ted_00824_0159570_0170430 Potable water , arable land , rainforests , oil , gas : they &apos;re going away , and they &apos;re going away soon , and unless we innovate our way out of this mess , we &apos;re going away too .
ted_00824_0170650_0172310 So the question is : Can we do that ?
ted_00824_0172330_0173870 And I think we can .
ted_00824_0174060_0179200 I think it &apos;s clear that we can make food that will feed billions of people without raping the land that they live on .
ted_00824_0179480_0182820 I think we can power this world with energy that doesn &apos;t also destroy it .
ted_00824_0183270_0186010 I really do believe that , and , no , it ain &apos;t wishful thinking .
ted_00824_0186290_0200380 But here &apos;s the thing that keeps me up at night - one of the things that keeps me up at night : We &apos;ve never needed progress in science more than we need it right now . Never . And we &apos;ve also never been in a position to deploy it properly in the way that we can today .
ted_00824_0200400_0217790 We &apos;re on the verge of amazing , amazing events in many fields , and yet I actually think we &apos;d have to go back hundreds , 300 years , before the Enlightenment , to find a time when we battled progress , when we fought about these things more vigorously , on more fronts , than we do now .
ted_00824_0217990_0222650 People wrap themselves in their beliefs , and they do it so tightly that you can &apos;t set them free .
ted_00824_0222840_0224520 Not even the truth will set them free .
ted_00824_0225060_0231720 And , listen , everyone &apos;s entitled to their opinion ; they &apos;re even entitled to their opinion about progress . But you know what you &apos;re not entitled to ?
ted_00824_0231880_0233540 You &apos;re not entitled to your own facts .
ted_00824_0233760_0234780 Sorry , you &apos;re not .
ted_00824_0235030_0236810 And this took me awhile to figure out .
ted_00824_0237040_0248390 About a decade ago , I wrote a story about vaccines for The New Yorker . A little story . And I was amazed to find opposition : opposition to what is , after all , the most effective public health measure in human history .
ted_00824_0249620_0254270 I didn &apos;t know what to do , so I just did what I do : I wrote a story and I moved on .
ted_00824_0254700_0259140 And soon after that , I wrote a story about genetically engineered food .
ted_00824_0259420_0260780 Same thing , only bigger .
ted_00824_0260940_0262200 People were going crazy .
ted_00824_0262410_0276020 So I wrote a story about that too , and I couldn &apos;t understand why people thought this was &quot; Frankenfoods , &quot; why they thought moving molecules around in a specific , rather than a haphazard way , was trespassing on nature &apos;s ground .
ted_00824_0276940_0278170 But , you know , I do what I do .
ted_00824_0278170_0279460 I wrote the story , I moved on .
ted_00824_0279460_0283310 I mean , I &apos;m a journalist . We type , we file , we go to dinner . It &apos;s fine .
ted_00824_0283245_0283445 ( Laughter )
ted_00824_0287590_0291010 But these stories bothered me , and I couldn &apos;t figure out why , and eventually I did .
ted_00824_0291010_0295940 And that &apos;s because those fanatics that were driving me crazy weren &apos;t actually fanatics at all .
ted_00824_0296120_0302090 They were thoughtful people , educated people , decent people . They were exactly like the people in this room .
ted_00824_0302860_0312840 And it just disturbed me so much . But then I thought , you know , let &apos;s be honest . We &apos;re at a point in this world where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress that we used to .
ted_00824_0312840_0314320 We talk about it ambivalently .
ted_00824_0314490_0323480 We talk about it in ironic terms with little quotes around it : &quot; progress . &quot; Okay , there are reasons for that , and I think we know what those reasons are .
ted_00824_0323480_0329980 We &apos;ve lost faith in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science itself , and there &apos;s no reason we shouldn &apos;t have .
ted_00824_0330680_0333980 You can just say a few names and people will understand .
ted_00824_0334520_0342190 Chernobyl , Bhopal , the Challenger , Vioxx , weapons of mass destruction , hanging chads .
ted_00824_0343590_0345460 You know , you can choose your list .
ted_00824_0346010_0356050 There are questions and problems with the people we used to believe were always right , so be skeptical . Ask questions , demand proof , demand evidence .
ted_00824_0356110_0357840 Don &apos;t take anything for granted .
ted_00824_0358010_0363920 But here &apos;s the thing : When you get proof , you need to accept the proof , and we &apos;re not that good at doing that .
ted_00824_0364060_0371060 And the reason that I can say that is because we &apos;re now in an epidemic of fear like one I &apos;ve never seen and hope never to see again .
ted_00824_0371420_0385870 About 12 years ago , there was a story published , a horrible story , that linked the epidemic of autism to the measles , mumps and rubella vaccine shot . Very scary . Tons of studies were done to see if this was true .
ted_00824_0386060_0388900 Tons of studies should have been done ; it &apos;s a serious issue .
ted_00824_0390040_0398900 The data came back . The data came back from the United States , from England , from Sweden , from Canada , and it was all the same : no correlation , no connection , none at all .
ted_00824_0398910_0413680 It doesn &apos;t matter . It doesn &apos;t matter because we believe anecdotes , we believe what we see , what we think we see , what makes us feel real . We don &apos;t believe a bunch of documents from a government official giving us data , and I do understand that , I think we all do .
ted_00824_0415240_0434430 The result of that has been disastrous . Disastrous because here &apos;s a fact : The United States is one of the only countries in the world where the vaccine rate for measles is going down . That is disgraceful , and we should be ashamed of ourselves . It &apos;s horrible . What kind of a thing happened that we could do that ?
ted_00824_0437160_0439510 I do understand it . Because , did anyone have measles here ?
ted_00824_0439510_0442410 Has one person in this audience ever seen someone die of measles ?
ted_00824_0443000_0448840 Doesn &apos;t happen very much . Doesn &apos;t happen in this country at all , but it happened 160,000 times in the world last year .
ted_00824_0448840_0468410 That &apos;s a lot of death of measles - 20 an hour . But since it didn &apos;t happen here , we can put it out of our minds , and people like Jenny McCarthy can go around preaching messages of fear and illiteracy from platforms like &quot; Oprah &quot; and &quot; Larry King Live . &quot; And they can do it because they don &apos;t link causation and correlation .
ted_00824_0469200_0473610 They don &apos;t understand that these things seem the same , but they &apos;re almost never the same .
ted_00824_0473750_0476810 And it &apos;s something we need to learn , and we need to learn it really soon .
ted_00824_0477890_0479400 This guy was a hero , Jonas Salk .
ted_00824_0479880_0484570 He took one of the worst scourges of mankind away from us . No fear , no agony .
ted_00824_0484630_0486050 Polio - puff , gone .
ted_00824_0486780_0489960 That guy in the middle , not so much . His name is Paul Offit .
ted_00824_0490070_0493390 He just developed a rotavirus vaccine with a bunch of other people .
ted_00824_0493410_0498160 It &apos;ll save the lives of 400 to 500,000 kids in the developing world every year .
ted_00824_0498160_0499200 Pretty good , right ?
ted_00824_0499890_0506230 Well , it &apos;s good , except that Paul goes around talking about vaccines and says how valuable they are and that people ought to just stop the whining .
ted_00824_0506690_0507780 And he actually says it that way .
ted_00824_0508150_0510300 So , Paul &apos;s a terrorist .
ted_00824_0511100_0515380 When Paul speaks in a public hearing , he can &apos;t testify without armed guards .
ted_00824_0515460_0523700 He gets called at home because people like to tell him that they remember where his kids go to school . And why ? Because Paul made a vaccine .
ted_00824_0524210_0527100 I don &apos;t need to say this , but vaccines are essential .
ted_00824_0527110_0531920 You take them away , disease comes back , horrible diseases . And that &apos;s happening .
ted_00824_0531930_0538160 We have measles in this country now . And it &apos;s getting worse , and pretty soon kids are going to die of it again because it &apos;s just a numbers game .
ted_00824_0538310_0546920 And they &apos;re not just going to die of measles . What about polio ? Let &apos;s have that . Why not ? A college classmate of mine wrote me a couple weeks ago and said she thought I was a little strident .
ted_00824_0546930_0548080 No one &apos;s ever said that before .
ted_00824_0549780_0558170 She wasn &apos;t going to vaccinate her kid against polio , no way . Fine . Why ? Because we don &apos;t have polio . And you know what ?
ted_00824_0558350_0560820 We didn &apos;t have polio in this country yesterday .
ted_00824_0561010_0566430 Today , I don &apos;t know , maybe a guy got on a plane in Lagos this morning , and he &apos;s flying to LAX , right now he &apos;s over Ohio .
ted_00824_0566900_0573960 And he &apos;s going to land in a couple of hours , he &apos;s going to rent a car , and he &apos;s going to come to Long Beach , and he &apos;s going to attend one of these fabulous TED dinners tonight .
ted_00824_0574380_0579690 And he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a paralytic disease , and we don &apos;t either because that &apos;s the way the world works .
ted_00824_0579740_0581030 That &apos;s the planet we live on .
ted_00824_0581480_0582530 Don &apos;t pretend it isn &apos;t .
ted_00824_0582840_0587740 Now , we love to wrap ourselves in lies . We love to do it . Everyone take their vitamins this morning ?
ted_00824_0588450_0591440 Echinacea , a little antioxidant to get you going .
ted_00824_0592150_0594960 I know you did because half of Americans do every day .
ted_00824_0595370_0602130 They take the stuff , and they take alternative medicines , and it doesn &apos;t matter how often we find out that they &apos;re useless .
ted_00824_0602270_0603640 The data says it all the time .
ted_00824_0603960_0604970 They darken your urine .
ted_00824_0604980_0612240 They almost never do more than that . ( Laughter ) It &apos;s okay , you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark urine ?
ted_00824_0612270_0620220 I &apos;m totally with you . ( Laughter ) Dark urine . Dark . Why do we do that ?
ted_00824_0620270_0620970 Why do we do that ?
ted_00824_0620970_0623370 Well , I think I understand , we hate Big Pharma .
ted_00824_0623440_0624430 We hate Big Government .
ted_00824_0624480_0625520 We don &apos;t trust the Man .
ted_00824_0625700_0628150 And we shouldn &apos;t : Our health care system sucks .
ted_00824_0628610_0630240 It &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
ted_00824_0630690_0636340 It &apos;s absolutely astonishingly cold and soul-bending to those of us who can even afford it .
ted_00824_0636520_0645430 So we run away from it , and where do we run ? We leap into the arms of Big Placebo . ( Laughter ) That &apos;s fantastic .
ted_00824_0645640_0646800 I love Big Placebo . ( Applause )
ted_00824_0651530_0657990 But , you know , it &apos;s really a serious thing because this stuff is crap , and we spend billions of dollars on it .
ted_00824_0658230_0660460 And I have all sorts of little props here .
ted_00824_0660940_0670550 None of it ... ginkgo , fraud ; echinacea , fraud ; acai - I don &apos;t even know what that is but we &apos;re spending billions of dollars on it - it &apos;s fraud . And you know what ?
ted_00824_0670570_0673410 When I say this stuff , people scream at me , and they say , &quot; What do you care ?
ted_00824_0673530_0674920 Let people do what they want to do .
ted_00824_0676190_0692920 It makes them feel good . &quot; And you know what ? You &apos;re wrong . Because I don &apos;t care if it &apos;s the secretary of HHS who &apos;s saying , &quot; Hmm , I &apos;m not going to take the evidence of my experts on mammograms , &quot; or some cancer quack who wants to treat his patient with coffee enemas .
ted_00824_0693090_0700030 When you start down the road where belief and magic replace evidence and science , you end up in a place you don &apos;t want to be .
ted_00824_0700210_0702410 You end up in Thabo Mbeki South Africa .
ted_00824_0702490_0712930 He killed 400,000 of his people by insisting that beetroot , garlic and lemon oil were much more effective than the antiretroviral drugs we know can slow the course of AIDS .
ted_00824_0712930_0719810 Hundreds of thousands of needless deaths in a country that has been plagued worse than any other by this disease .
ted_00824_0720670_0725680 Please , don &apos;t tell me there are no consequences to these things . There are . There always are .
ted_00824_0726390_0736440 Now , the most mindless epidemic we &apos;re in the middle of right now is this absurd battle between proponents of genetically engineered food and the organic elite .
ted_00824_0736910_0739050 It &apos;s an idiotic debate . It has to stop .
ted_00824_0739090_0741150 It &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
ted_00824_0741860_0743500 It &apos;s ideology , it &apos;s not science .
ted_00824_0743740_0751540 Every single thing we eat , every grain of rice , every sprig of parsley , every Brussels sprout has been modified by man .
ted_00824_0751680_0753850 You know , there weren &apos;t tangerines in the garden of Eden .
ted_00824_0754250_0757350 There wasn &apos;t any cantaloupe . ( Laughter ) There weren &apos;t Christmas trees .
ted_00824_0757590_0758960 We made it all .
ted_00824_0759050_0761060 We made it over the last 11,000 years .
ted_00824_0761060_0763990 And some of it worked , and some of it didn &apos;t .
ted_00824_0764450_0765750 We got rid of the stuff that didn &apos;t .
ted_00824_0765980_0777680 Now we can do it in a more precise way - and there are risks , absolutely - but we can put something like vitamin A into rice , and that stuff can help millions of people , millions of people , prolong their lives .
ted_00824_0778860_0779690 You don &apos;t want to do that ?
ted_00824_0780700_0783090 I have to say , I don &apos;t understand it .
ted_00824_0783880_0786850 We object to genetically engineered food .
ted_00824_0786860_0787750 Why do we do that ?
ted_00824_0787930_0797730 Well , the things I constantly hear are : Too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , monoculture , we don &apos;t want giant fields of the same thing , that &apos;s wrong .
ted_00824_0798520_0800510 We don &apos;t companies patenting life .
ted_00824_0800550_0802120 We don &apos;t want companies owning seeds .
ted_00824_0802120_0811040 And you know what my response to all of that is ? Yes , you &apos;re right . Let &apos;s fix it . It &apos;s true , we &apos;ve got a huge food problem , but this isn &apos;t science .
ted_00824_0811640_0812790 This has nothing to do with science .
ted_00824_0812940_0815280 It &apos;s law , it &apos;s morality , it &apos;s patent stuff .
ted_00824_0815480_0817320 You know science isn &apos;t a company .
ted_00824_0817700_0818780 It &apos;s not a country .
ted_00824_0819450_0822020 It &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
ted_00824_0822720_0838830 It &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn &apos;t , but the idea that we should not allow science to do its job because we &apos;re afraid , is really very deadening , and it &apos;s preventing millions of people from prospering .
ted_00824_0838870_0845680 You know , in the next 50 years we &apos;re going to have to grow 70 percent more food than we do right now , 70 percent .
ted_00824_0846020_0860840 This investment in Africa over the last 30 years . Disgraceful . Disgraceful . They need it , and we &apos;re not giving it to them . And why ? Genetically engineered food . We don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat that rotten stuff , like cassava for instance .
ted_00824_0860840_0863390 Cassava &apos;s something that half a billion people eat .
ted_00824_0863390_0864520 It &apos;s kind of like a potato .
ted_00824_0864960_0872400 It &apos;s just a bunch of calories . It sucks . It doesn &apos;t have nutrients , it doesn &apos;t have protein , and scientists are engineering all of that into it right now .
ted_00824_0873100_0876230 And then people would be able to eat it and they &apos;d be able to not go blind .
ted_00824_0876290_0882090 They wouldn &apos;t starve , and you know what ? That would be nice . It wouldn &apos;t be Chez Panisse , but it would be nice .
ted_00824_0884450_0888880 And all I can say about this is : Why are we fighting it ?
ted_00824_0889360_0890930 I mean , let &apos;s ask ourselves : Why are we fighting it ?
ted_00824_0890960_0893440 Because we don &apos;t want to move genes around ?
ted_00824_0893440_0895690 This is about moving genes around . It &apos;s not about chemicals .
ted_00824_0896180_0903030 It &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our insistence on having bigger food , better food , singular food .
ted_00824_0903580_0909720 This isn &apos;t about Rice Krispies , this is about keeping people alive , and it &apos;s about time we started to understand what that meant .
ted_00824_0909940_0910940 Because , you know something ?
ted_00824_0911490_0919390 If we don &apos;t , if we continue to act the way we &apos;re acting , we &apos;re guilty of something that I don &apos;t think we want to be guilty of : high-tech colonialism .
ted_00824_0919490_0921920 There &apos;s no other way to describe what &apos;s going on here .
ted_00824_0922190_0927740 It &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s beneath us , and we really have to stop it .
ted_00824_0928950_0941040 So after this amazingly fun conversation , ( Laughter ) you might want to say , &quot; So , you still want to get in this ridiculous time machine and go forward ? &quot; Absolutely . Absolutely , I do .
ted_00824_0941360_0944500 It &apos;s stuck in the present right now , but we have an amazing opportunity .
ted_00824_0944740_0947610 We can set that time machine on anything we want .
ted_00824_0947770_0951960 We can move it where we want to move it , and we &apos;re going to move it where we want to move it .
ted_00824_0952130_0959650 We have to have these conversations and we have to think , but when we get in the time machine and we go ahead , we &apos;re going to be happy we do .
ted_00824_0960300_0972610 I know that we can , and as far as I &apos;m concerned , that &apos;s something the world needs right now .
ted_00824_0972580_0972780 ( Applause ) Thank you .
ted_00837_0013010_0018600 Several years ago here at TED , Peter Skillman introduced a design challenge called the marshmallow challenge .
ted_00837_0018810_0029520 And the idea &apos;s pretty simple : Teams of four have to build the tallest free-standing structure out of 20 sticks of spaghetti , one yard of tape , one yard of string and a marshmallow .
ted_00837_0029530_0031190 The marshmallow has to be on top .
ted_00837_0031540_0038050 And , though it seems really simple , it &apos;s actually pretty hard because it forces people to collaborate very quickly .
ted_00837_0038440_0042730 And so , I thought this was an interesting idea , and I incorporated it into a design workshop .
ted_00837_0042990_0044560 And it was a huge success .
ted_00837_0044840_0062050 And since then , I &apos;ve conducted about 70 design workshops across the world with students and designers and architects , even the CTOs of the Fortune 50 , and there &apos;s something about this exercise that reveals very deep lessons about the nature of collaboration , and I &apos;d like to share some of them with you .
ted_00837_0062710_0068300 So , normally , most people begin by orienting themselves to the task .
ted_00837_0068310_0073010 They talk about it , they figure out what it &apos;s going to look like , they jockey for power .
ted_00837_0073240_0077440 Then they spend some time planning , organizing , they sketch and they lay out spaghetti .
ted_00837_0078070_0095740 They spend the majority of their time assembling the sticks into ever-growing structures . And then finally , just as they &apos;re running out of time , someone takes out the marshmallow , and then they gingerly put it on top , and then they stand back , and - ta-da ! - they admire their work .
ted_00837_0096130_0105490 But what really happens , most of the time , is that the &quot; ta-da &quot; turns into an &quot; uh-oh , &quot; because the weight of the marshmallow causes the entire structure to buckle and to collapse .
ted_00837_0105630_0121160 So there are a number of people who have a lot more &quot; uh-oh &quot; moments than others , and among the worst are recent graduates of business school . ( Laughter ) They lie , they cheat , they get distracted and they produce really lame structures .
ted_00837_0121390_0132600 And of course there are teams that have a lot more &quot; ta-da &quot; structures , and among the best are recent graduates of kindergarten . ( Laughter ) And it &apos;s pretty amazing .
ted_00837_0132630_0139200 As Peter tells us , not only do they produce the tallest structures , but they &apos;re the most interesting structures of them all .
ted_00837_0139220_0143200 So the question you want to ask is : How come ? Why ? What is it about them ?
ted_00837_0143200_0151850 And Peter likes to say that none of the kids spend any time trying to be CEO of Spaghetti , Inc . Right ? They don &apos;t spend time jockeying for power .
ted_00837_0151850_0153250 But there &apos;s another reason as well .
ted_00837_0153600_0159310 And the reason is that business students are trained to find the single right plan , right ?
ted_00837_0159470_0160610 And then they execute on it .
ted_00837_0160820_0164950 And then what happens is , when they put the marshmallow on the top , they run out of time and what happens ?
ted_00837_0165070_0182770 It &apos;s a crisis . Sound familiar ? Right . What kindergarteners do differently is that they start with the marshmallow , and they build prototypes , successive prototypes , always keeping the marshmallow on top , so they have multiple times to fix when they build prototypes along the way .
ted_00837_0182830_0187610 Designers recognize this type of collaboration as the essence of the iterative process .
ted_00837_0187890_0192510 And with each version , kids get instant feedback about what works and what doesn &apos;t work .
ted_00837_0192870_0198660 So the capacity to play in prototype is really essential , but let &apos;s look at how different teams perform .
ted_00837_0198950_0209180 So the average for most people is around 20 inches ; business schools students , about half of that ; lawyers , a little better , but not much better than that , kindergarteners , better than most adults .
ted_00837_0209440_0210500 Who does the very best ?
ted_00837_0210790_0228170 Architects and engineers , thankfully . ( Laughter ) Thirty-nine inches is the tallest structure I &apos;ve seen . And why is it ? Because they understand triangles and self-reinforcing geometrical patterns are the key to building stable structures .
ted_00837_0228180_0235470 So CEOs , a little bit better than average , but here &apos;s where it gets interesting .
ted_00837_0235660_0242640 If you put you put an executive admin. on the team , they get significantly better . ( Laughter ) It &apos;s incredible .
ted_00837_0242940_0250660 You know , you look around , you go , &quot; Oh , that team &apos;s going to win . &quot; You can just tell beforehand . And why is that ? Because they have special skills of facilitation .
ted_00837_0250850_0253340 They manage the process , they understand the process .
ted_00837_0253520_0261050 And any team who manages and pays close attention to work will significantly improve the team &apos;s performance .
ted_00837_0261650_0266570 Specialized skills and facilitation skills are the combination that leads to strong success .
ted_00837_0267660_0271690 If you have 10 teams that typically perform , you &apos;ll get maybe six or so that have standing structures .
ted_00837_0271690_0273570 And I tried something interesting .
ted_00837_0273570_0275760 I thought , let &apos;s up the ante , once .
ted_00837_0275760_0279010 So I offered a 10,000 dollar prize of software to the winning team .
ted_00837_0279010_0281960 So what do you think happened to these design students ?
ted_00837_0282680_0283400 What was the result ?
ted_00837_0285260_0289960 Here &apos;s what happened : Not one team had a standing structure .
ted_00837_0290580_0295950 If anyone had built , say , a one inch structure , they would have taken home the prize .
ted_00837_0296220_0300100 So , isn &apos;t that interesting ? That high stakes have a strong impact .
ted_00837_0300350_0302560 We did the exercise again with the same students .
ted_00837_0302810_0303870 What do you think happened then ?
ted_00837_0303880_0306130 So now they understand the value of prototyping .
ted_00837_0309620_0313880 So the same team went from being the very worst to being among the very best .
ted_00837_0313880_0316840 They produced the tallest structures in the least amount of time .
ted_00837_0317020_0321580 So there &apos;s deep lessons for us about the nature of incentives and success .
ted_00837_0322380_0327180 So , you might ask : Why would anyone actually spend time writing a marshmallow challenge ?
ted_00837_0327380_0334470 And the reason is , I help create digital tools and processes to help teams build cars and video games and visual effects .
ted_00837_0335330_0340230 And what the marshmallow challenge does is it helps them identify the hidden assumptions .
ted_00837_0340450_0345270 Because , frankly , every project has its own marshmallow , doesn &apos;t it ?
ted_00837_0345390_0351370 The challenge provides a shared experience , a common language , a common stance to build the right prototype .
ted_00837_0351610_0355750 And so , this is the value of the experience , of this so simple exercise .
ted_00837_0355750_0363060 And those of you who are interested may want to go to MarshmallowChallenge.com. It &apos;s a blog that you can look at how to build the marshmallows .
ted_00837_0363080_0365030 There &apos;s step-by-step instructions on this .
ted_00837_0365460_0370000 There are crazy examples from around the world of how people tweak and adjust the system .
ted_00837_0370260_0372020 There &apos;s world records that are on this as well .
ted_00837_0372340_0377590 And the fundamental lesson , I believe , is that design truly is a contact sport .
ted_00837_0378410_0387930 It demands that we bring all of our senses to the task , and that we apply the very best of our thinking , our feeling and our doing to the challenge that we have at hand .
ted_00837_0387930_0395310 And sometimes , a little prototype of this experience is all that it takes to turn us from an &quot; uh-oh &quot; moment to a &quot; ta-da &quot; moment .
ted_00837_0395570_0397740 And that can make a big difference .
ted_00837_0398050_0398770 Thank you very much .
